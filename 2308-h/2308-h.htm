<h1>BUNYAN CHARACTERS&mdash;THIRD SERIES<br />
Lectures Delivered in St. George&rsquo;s Free Church Edinburgh<br />
By Alexander Whyte, D.D.</h1>
<h2>CHAPTER I&mdash;THE BOOK</h2>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;&mdash;the book of the wars of the Lord.&rsquo;&mdash;<i>Moses</i>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>John Bunyan&rsquo;s <i>Holy War</i> was first published in 1682,
six years before its illustrious author&rsquo;s death.&nbsp; Bunyan
wrote this great book when he was still in all the fulness of his intellectual
power and in all the ripeness of his spiritual experience.&nbsp; The
<i>Holy War</i> is not the <i>Pilgrim&rsquo;s Progress</i>&mdash;there
is only one <i>Pilgrim&rsquo;s Progress</i>.&nbsp; At the same time,
we have Lord Macaulay&rsquo;s word for it that if the <i>Pilgrim&rsquo;s
Progress</i> did not exist the <i>Holy War</i> would be the best allegory
that ever was written: and even Mr. Froude admits that the <i>Holy War</i>
alone would have entitled its author to rank high up among the acknowledged
masters of English literature.&nbsp; The intellectual rank of the <i>Holy
War</i> has been fixed before that tribunal over which our accomplished
and competent critics preside; but for a full appreciation of its religious
rank and value we would need to hear the glad testimonies of tens of
thousands of God&rsquo;s saints, whose hard-beset faith and obedience
have been kindled and sustained by the study of this noble book.&nbsp;
The <i>Pilgrim&rsquo;s Progress</i> sets forth the spiritual life under
the scriptural figure of a long and an uphill journey.&nbsp; The <i>Holy
War</i>, on the other hand, is a military history; it is full of soldiers
and battles, defeats and victories.&nbsp; And its devout author had
much more scriptural suggestion and support in the composition of the
<i>Holy War</i> than he had even in the composition of the <i>Pilgrim&rsquo;s
Progress</i>.&nbsp; For Holy Scripture is full of wars and rumours of
wars: the wars of the Lord; the wars of Joshua and the Judges; the wars
of David, with his and many other magnificent battle-songs; till the
best known name of the God of Israel in the Old Testament is the Lord
of Hosts; and then in the New Testament we have Jesus Christ described
as the Captain of our salvation.&nbsp; Paul&rsquo;s powerful use of
armour and of armed men is familiar to every student of his epistles;
and then the whole Bible is crowned with a book all sounding with the
battle-cries, the shouts, and the songs of soldiers, till it ends with
that city of peace where they hang the trumpet in the hall and study
war no more.&nbsp; Military metaphors had taken a powerful hold of our
author&rsquo;s imagination even in the <i>Pilgrim&rsquo;s Progress</i>,
as his portraits of Greatheart and Valiant-for-truth and other soldiers
sufficiently show; while the conflict with Apollyon and the destruction
of Doubting Castle are so many sure preludes of the coming <i>Holy War</i>.&nbsp;
Bunyan&rsquo;s early experiences in the great Civil War had taught him
many memorable things about the military art; memorable and suggestive
things that he afterwards put to the most splendid use in the siege,
the capture, and the subjugation of Mansoul.</p>
<p>The <i>Divine Comedy</i> is beyond dispute the greatest book of personal
and experimental religion the world has ever seen.&nbsp; The consuming
intensity of its author&rsquo;s feelings about sin and holiness, the
keenness and the bitterness of his remorse, and the rigour and the severity
of his revenge, his superb intellect and his universal learning, all
set ablaze by his splendid imagination&mdash;all that combines to make
the <i>Divine Comedy</i> the unapproachable masterpiece it is.&nbsp;
John Bunyan, on the other hand, had no learning to be called learning,
but he had a strong and a healthy English understanding, a conscience
and a heart wholly given up to the life of the best religion of his
religious day, and then, by sheer dint of his sanctified and soaring
imagination and his exquisite style, he stands forth the peer of the
foremost men in the intellectual world.&nbsp; And thus it is that the
great unlettered religious world possesses in John Bunyan all but all
that the select and scholarly world possesses in Dante.&nbsp; Both Dante
and Bunyan devoted their splendid gifts to the noblest of services&mdash;the
service of spiritual, and especially of personal religion; but for one
appreciative reader that Dante has had Bunyan has had a hundred.&nbsp;
Happy in being so like his Master in so many things, Bunyan is happy
in being like his unlettered Master in this also, that the common people
hear him gladly and never weary of hearing him.</p>
<p>It gives by far its noblest interest to Dante&rsquo;s noble book
that we have Dante himself in every page of his book.&nbsp; Dante is
taken down into Hell, he is then led up through <i>Purgatory</i>, and
after that still up and up into the very Paradise of God.&nbsp; But
that hell all the time is the hell that Dante had dug and darkened and
kindled for himself.&nbsp; In the Purgatory, again, we see Dante working
out his own salvation with fear and trembling, God all the time working
in Dante to will and to do of His good pleasure.&nbsp; And then the
Paradise, with all its sevenfold glory, is just that place and that
life which God hath prepared for them that love Him and serve Him as
Dante did.&nbsp; And so it is in the <i>Holy War</i>.&nbsp; John Bunyan
is in the <i>Pilgrim&rsquo;s Progress</i>, but there are more men and
other men than its author in that rich and populous book, and other
experiences and other attainments than his.&nbsp; But in the <i>Holy
War</i> we have Bunyan himself as fully and as exclusively as we have
Dante in the <i>Divine Comedy</i>.&nbsp; In the first edition of the
<i>Holy War</i> there is a frontispiece conceived and executed after
the anatomical and symbolical manner which was so common in that day,
and which is to be seen at its perfection in the English edition of
Jacob Behmen.&nbsp; The frontispiece is a full-length likeness of the
author of the <i>Holy War</i>, with his whole soul laid open and his
hidden heart &lsquo;anatomised.&rsquo;&nbsp; Why, asked Wordsworth,
and Matthew Arnold in our day has echoed the question&mdash;why does
Homer still so live and rule without a rival in the world of letters?&nbsp;
And they answer that it is because he always sang with his eye so fixed
upon its object.&nbsp; &lsquo;Homer, to thee I turn.&rsquo;&nbsp; And
so it was with Dante.&nbsp; And so it was with Bunyan.&nbsp; Bunyan&rsquo;s
<i>Holy War</i> has its great and abiding and commanding power over
us just because he composed it with his eye fixed on his own heart.</p>
<blockquote><p>My readers, I have somewhat else to do,<br />
Than with vain stories thus to trouble you;<br />
What here I say some men do know so well<br />
They can with tears and joy the story tell . . .<br />
Then lend thine ear to what I do relate,<br />
Touching the town of Mansoul and her state:<br />
For my part, I (myself) was in the town,<br />
Both when &rsquo;twas set up and when pulling down.<br />
Let no man then count me a fable-maker,<br />
Nor make my name or credit a partaker<br />
Of their derision: what is here in view<br />
Of mine own knowledge, I dare say is true.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The characters in the <i>Holy War</i> are not as a rule nearly so
clear-cut or so full of dramatic life and movement as their fellows
are in the <i>Pilgrim&rsquo;s Progress</i>, and Bunyan seems to have
felt that to be the case.&nbsp; He shows all an author&rsquo;s fondness
for the children of his imagination in the <i>Pilgrim&rsquo;s Progress</i>.&nbsp;
He returns to and he lingers on their doings and their sayings and their
very names with all a foolish father&rsquo;s fond delight.&nbsp; While,
on the other hand, when we look to see him in his confidential addresses
to his readers returning upon some of the military and municipal characters
in the <i>Holy War</i>, to our disappointment he does not so much as
name a single one of them, though he dwells with all an author&rsquo;s
self-delectation on the outstanding scenes, situations, and episodes
of his remarkable book.</p>
<p>What, then, are some of the more outstanding scenes, situations,
and episodes, as well as military and municipal characters, in the book
now before us?&nbsp; And what are we to promise ourselves, and to expect,
from the study and the exposition of the <i>Holy War</i> in these lectures?&nbsp;
Well, to begin with, we shall do our best to enter with mind, and heart,
and conscience, and imagination into Bunyan&rsquo;s great conception
of the human soul as a city, a fair and a delicate city and corporation,
with its situation, surroundings, privileges and fortunes.&nbsp; We
shall then enter under his guidance into the famous and stately palace
of this metropolitan city; a palace which for strength might be called
a castle, for pleasantness a paradise, and for largeness a place so
copious as to contain all the world.&nbsp; The walls and the gates of
the city will then occupy and instruct us for several Sabbath evenings,
after which we shall enter on the record of the wars and battles that
rolled time after time round those city walls, and surged up through
its captured gates till they quite overwhelmed the very palace of the
king itself.&nbsp; Then we shall spend, God willing, one Sabbath evening
with Loth-to-stoop, and another with old Ill-pause, the devil&rsquo;s
orator, and another with Captain Anything, and another with Lord Willbewill,
and another with that notorious villain Clip-promise, by whose doings
so much of the king&rsquo;s coin had been abused, and another with that
so angry and so ill-conditioned churl old Mr. Prejudice, with his sixty
deaf men under him.&nbsp; Dear Mr. Wet-eyes, with his rope upon his
head, will have a fit congregation one winter night, and Captain Self-denial
another.&nbsp; We shall have another painful but profitable evening
before a communion season with Mr. Prywell, and so we shall eat of that
bread and drink of that cup.&nbsp; Emmanuel&rsquo;s livery will occupy
us one evening, Mansoul&rsquo;s Magna Charta another, and her annual
Feast-day another.&nbsp; Her Established Church and her beneficed clergy
will take up one evening, some Skulkers in Mansoul another, the devil&rsquo;s
last prank another, and then, to wind up with, Emmanuel&rsquo;s last
speech and charge to Mansoul from his chariot-step till He comes again
to accomplish her rapture.&nbsp; All that we shall see and take part
in; unless, indeed, our Captain comes in anger before the time, and
spears us to the earth when He finds us asleep at our post or in the
act of sin at it, which may His abounding mercy forbid!</p>
<p>And now take these three forewarnings and precautions.</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; First:&mdash;All who come here on these coming Sabbath evenings
will not understand the <i>Holy War</i> all at once, and many will not
understand it at all.&nbsp; And little blame to them, and no wonder.&nbsp;
For, fully to understand this deep and intricate book demands far more
mind, far more experience, and far more specialised knowledge than the
mass of men, as men are, can possibly bring to it.&nbsp; This so exacting
book demands of us, to begin with, some little acquaintance with military
engineering and architecture; with the theory of, and if possible with
some practice in, attack and defence in sieges and storms, winter campaigns
and long drawn-out wars.&nbsp; And then, impossible as it sounds and
is, along with all that we would need to have a really profound, practical,
and at first-hand acquaintance with the anatomy of the human subject,
and especially with cardiac anatomy, as well as with all the conditions,
diseases, regimen and discipline of the corrupt heart of man.&nbsp;
And then it is enough to terrify any one to open this book or to enter
this church when he is told that if he comes here he must be ready and
willing to have the whole of this terrible and exacting book fulfilled
and experienced in himself, in his own body and in his own soul.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; And, then, you will not all like the <i>Holy War</i>.&nbsp;
The mass of men could not be expected to like any such book.&nbsp; How
could the vain and blind citizen of a vain and blind city like to be
wakened up, as Paris was wakened up within our own remembrance, to find
all her gates in the hands of an iron-hearted enemy?&nbsp; And how could
her sons like to be reminded, as they sit in their wine gardens, that
they are thereby fast preparing their city for that threatened day when
she is to be hung up on her own walls and bled to the white?&nbsp; Who
would not hate and revile the book or the preacher who prophesied such
rough things as that?&nbsp; Who could love the author or the preacher
who told him to his face that his eyes and his ears and all the passes
to his heart were already in the hands of a cruel, ruthless, and masterful
enemy?&nbsp; No wonder that you never read the <i>Holy War</i>.&nbsp;
No wonder that the bulk of men have never once opened it.&nbsp; The
Downfall is not a favourite book in the night-gardens of Paris.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; And then, few, very few, it is to be feared, will be any
better of the <i>Holy War</i>.&nbsp; For, to be any better of such a
terrible book as this is, we must at all costs lay it, and lay it all,
and lay it all at once, to heart.&nbsp; We must submit ourselves to
see ourselves continually in its blazing glass.&nbsp; We must stoop
to be told that it is all, in all its terrors and in all its horrors,
literally true of ourselves.&nbsp; We must deliberately and resolutely
set open every gate that opens in on our heart&mdash;Ear-gate and Eye-gate
and all the gates of sense and intellect, day and night, to Jesus Christ
to enter in; and we must shut and bolt and bar every such gate in the
devil&rsquo;s very face, and in the face of all his scouts and orators,
day and night also.&nbsp; But who that thinks, and that knows by experience
what all that means, will feel himself sufficient for all that?&nbsp;
No man: no sinful man.&nbsp; But, among many other noble and blessed
things, the <i>Holy War</i> will show us that our sufficiency in this
impossibility also is all of God.&nbsp; Who, then, will enlist?&nbsp;
Who will risk all and enlist?&nbsp; Who will matriculate in the military
school of Mansoul?&nbsp; Who will submit himself to all the severity
of its divine discipline?&nbsp; Who will be made willing to throw open
and to keep open his whole soul, with all the gates and doors thereof,
to all the sieges, assaults, capitulations, submissions, occupations,
and such like of the war of gospel holiness?&nbsp; And who will enlist
under that banner now?</p>
<p>&lsquo;Set down my name, sir,&rsquo; said a man of a very stout countenance
to him who had the inkhorn at the outer gate.&nbsp; At which those who
walked upon the top of the palace broke out in a very pleasant voice,</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Come in, come in;<br />
Eternal glory thou shalt win.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We have no longer, after what we have come through, any such stoutness
in our countenance, yet will we say to-night with him who had it, Set
down my name also, sir!</p>
<h2>CHAPTER II&mdash;THE CITY OF MANSOUL AND ITS CINQUE PORTS</h2>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;&mdash;a besieged city.&rsquo;&mdash;<i>Isaiah</i>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Our greatest historians have been wont to leave their books behind
them and to make long journeys in order to see with their own eyes the
ruined sites of ancient cities and the famous fields where the great
battles of the world were lost and won.&nbsp; We all remember how Macaulay
made a long winter journey to see the Pass of Killiecrankie before he
sat down to write upon it; and Carlyle&rsquo;s magnificent battle-pieces
are not all imagination; even that wonderful writer had to see Frederick&rsquo;s
battlefields with his own eyes before he could trust himself to describe
them.&nbsp; And he tells us himself how Cromwell&rsquo;s splendid generalship
all came up before him as he looked down on the town of Dunbar and out
upon the ever-memorable country round about it.&nbsp; John Bunyan was
not a great historian; he was only a common soldier in the great Civil
War of the seventeenth century; but what would we not give for a description
from his vivid pen of the famous fields and the great sieges in which
he took part?&nbsp; What a find John Bunyan&rsquo;s &lsquo;Journals&rsquo;
and &lsquo;Letters Home from the Seat of War&rsquo; would be to our
historians and to their readers!&nbsp; But, alas! such journals and
letters do not exist.&nbsp; Bunyan&rsquo;s complete silence in all his
books about the battles and the sieges he took his part in is very remarkable,
and his silence is full of significance.&nbsp; The Puritan soldier keeps
all his military experiences to work them all up into his <i>Holy War</i>,
the one and only war that ever kindled all his passions and filled his
every waking thought.&nbsp; But since John Bunyan was a man of genius,
equal in his own way to Cromwell and Milton themselves, if I were a
soldier I would keep ever before me the great book in which Bunyan&rsquo;s
experiences and observations and reflections as a soldier are all worked
up.&nbsp; I would set that classical book on the same shelf with C&aelig;sar&rsquo;s
<i>Commentaries</i> and Napier&rsquo;s <i>Peninsula</i>, and Carlyle&rsquo;s
glorious battle-pieces.&nbsp; Even C&aelig;sar has been accused of too
great dryness and coldness in his Commentaries, but there is neither
dryness nor coldness in John Bunyan&rsquo;s <i>Holy War</i>.&nbsp; To
read Bunyan kindles our cold civilian blood like the waving of a banner
and like the sound of a trumpet.</p>
<p>The situation of the city of Mansoul occupies one of the most beautiful
pages of this whole book.&nbsp; The opening of the <i>Holy War</i>,
simply as a piece of English, is worthy to stand beside the best page
of the <i>Pilgrim&rsquo;s Progress</i> itself, and what more can I say
than that?&nbsp; Now, the situation of a city is a matter of the very
first importance.&nbsp; Indeed, the insight and the foresight of the
great statesmen and the great soldiers of past ages are seen in nothing
more than in the sites they chose for their citadels and for their defenced
cities.&nbsp; Well, then, as to the situation of Mansoul, &lsquo;it
lieth,&rsquo; says our military author, &lsquo;just between the two
worlds.&rsquo;&nbsp; That is to say: very much as Germany in our day
lies between France and Russia, and very much as Palestine in her day
lay between Egypt and Assyria, so does Mansoul lie between two immense
empires also.&nbsp; And, surely, I do not need to explain to any man
here who has a man&rsquo;s soul in his bosom that the two armed empires
that besiege his soul are Heaven above and Hell beneath, and that both
Heaven and Hell would give their best blood and their best treasure
to subdue and to possess his soul.&nbsp; We do not value our souls at
all as Heaven and Hell value them.&nbsp; There are savage tribes in
Africa and in Asia who inhabit territories that are sleeplessly envied
by the expanding and extending nations of Europe.&nbsp; Ancient and
mighty empires in Europe raise armies, and build navies, and levy taxes,
and spill the blood of their bravest sons like water in order to possess
the harbours, and the rivers, and the mountains, and the woods amid
which their besotted owners roam in utter ignorance of all the plots
and preparations of the Western world.&nbsp; And Heaven and Hell are
not unlike those ancient and over-peopled nations of Europe whose teeming
millions must have an outlet to other lands.&nbsp; Their life and their
activity are too large and too rich for their original territories,
and thus they are compelled to seek out colonies and dependencies, so
that their surplus population may have a home.&nbsp; And, in like manner,
Heaven is too full of love and of blessedness to have all that for ever
shut up within itself, and Hell is too full of envy and ill-will, and
thus there continually come about those contentions and collisions of
which the <i>Holy War</i> is full.&nbsp; And, besides, it is with Mansoul
and her neighbour states of Heaven and Hell just as it is with some
of our great European empires in this also.&nbsp; There is no neutral
zone, no buffer state, no silver streak between Mansoul and her immediate
and military neighbours.&nbsp; And thus it is that her statesmen, and
her soldiers, and even her very common-soldier sentries must be for
ever on the watch; they must never say peace, peace; they must never
leave for one moment their appointed post.</p>
<p>And then, as for the wall of the city, hear our excellent historian&rsquo;s
own words about that.&nbsp; &lsquo;The wall of the town was well built,&rsquo;
so he says.&nbsp; &lsquo;Yea, so fast and firm was it knit and compact
together that, had it not been for the townsmen themselves, it could
not have been shaken or broken down for ever.&nbsp; For here lay the
excellent wisdom of Him that builded Mansoul, that the walls could never
be broken down nor hurt by the most mighty adverse potentate unless
the townsmen gave their consent thereto.&rsquo;&nbsp; Now, what would
the military engineers of Chatham and Paris and Berlin, who are now
at their wits&rsquo; end, not give for a secret like that!&nbsp; A wall
impregnable and insurmountable and not to be sapped or mined from the
outside: a wall that could only suffer hurt from the inside!&nbsp; And
then that wonderful wall was pierced from within with five magnificently
answerable gates.&nbsp; That is to say, the gates could neither be burst
in nor any way forced from without.&nbsp; &lsquo;This famous town of
Mansoul had five gates, in at which to come, out of which to go; and
these were made likewise answerable to the walls; to wit, impregnable,
and such as could never be opened or forced but by the will and leave
of those within.&nbsp; The names of the gates were these: Ear-gate,
Eye-gate, Mouth-gate; in short, &lsquo;the five senses,&rsquo; as we
say.</p>
<p>In the south of England, in the time of Edward the Confessor and
after the battle of Hastings, there were five cities which had special
immunities and peculiar privileges bestowed upon them, in recognition
of the special dangers to which they were exposed and the eminent services
they performed as facing the hostile shores of France.&nbsp; Owing to
their privileges and their position, the &lsquo;Cinque Ports&rsquo;
came to be cities of great strength, till, as time went on, they became
a positive weakness rather than a strength to the land that lay behind
them.&nbsp; Privilege bred pride, and in their pride the Cinque Ports
proclaimed wars and formed alliances on their own account: piracies
by sea and robberies by land were hatched within their walls; and it
took centuries to reduce those pampered and arrogant ports to the safe
and peaceful rank of ordinary English cities.&nbsp; The Revolution of
1688 did something, and the Reform Bill of 1832 did more to make Dover
and her insolent sisters like the other free and equal cities of England;
but to this day there are remnants of public shows and pageantries left
in those old towns sufficient to witness to the former privileges, power,
and pride of the famous Cinque Ports.&nbsp; Now, Mansoul, in like manner,
has her cinque ports.&nbsp; And the whole of the <i>Holy War</i> is
one long and detailed history of how the five senses are clothed with
such power as they possess; how they abuse and misuse their power; what
disloyalty and despite they show to their sovereign; what conspiracies
and depredations they enter into; what untold miseries they let in upon
themselves and upon the land that lies behind them; what years and years
of siege, legislation, and rule it takes to reduce our bodily senses,
those proud and licentious gates, to their true and proper allegiance,
and to make their possessors a people loyal and contented, law-abiding
and happy.</p>
<p>The Apostle has a terrible passage to the Corinthians, in which he
treats of the soul and the senses with tremendous and overwhelming power.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Your bodies and your bodily members,&rsquo; he argues, with crushing
indignation, &lsquo;are not your own to do with them as you like.&nbsp;
Your bodies and your souls are both Christ&rsquo;s.&nbsp; He has bought
your body and your soul at an incalculable cost.&nbsp; What! know ye
not that your body is nothing less than the temple of the Holy Ghost
which is in you, and ye are not any more your own? know ye not that
your bodies are the very members of Christ?&rsquo;&nbsp; And then he
says a thing so terrible that I tremble to transcribe it.&nbsp; For
a more terrible thing was never written.&nbsp; &lsquo;Shall I then,&rsquo;
filled with shame he demands, &lsquo;take the members of Christ and
make them the members of an harlot?&rsquo;&nbsp; O God, have mercy on
me!&nbsp; I knew all the time that I was abusing and polluting myself,
but I did not know, I did not think, I was never told that I was abusing
and polluting Thy Son, Jesus Christ.&nbsp; Oh, too awful thought.&nbsp;
And yet, stupid sinner that I am, I had often read that if any man defile
the temple of God and the members of Christ, him shall God destroy.&nbsp;
O God, destroy me not as I see now that I deserve.&nbsp; Spare me that
I may cleanse and sanctify myself and the members of Christ in me, which
I have so often embruted and defiled.&nbsp; Assist me to summon up my
imagination henceforth to my sanctification as Thine apostle has here
taught me the way.&nbsp; Let me henceforth look at my whole body in
all its senses and in all its members, the most open and the most secret,
as in reality no more my own.&nbsp; Let me henceforth look at myself
with Paul&rsquo;s deep and holy eyes.&nbsp; Let me henceforth seat Christ,
my Redeemer and my King, in the very throne of my heart, and then keep
every gate of my body and every avenue of my mind as all not any more
mine own but His.&nbsp; Let me open my eye, and my ear, and my mouth,
as if in all that I were opening Christ&rsquo;s eye and Christ&rsquo;s
ear and Christ&rsquo;s mouth; and let me thrust in nothing on Him as
He dwells within me that will make Him ashamed or angry, or that will
defile and pollute Him.&nbsp; That thought, O God, I feel that it will
often arrest me in time to come in the very act of sin.&nbsp; It will
make me start back before I make Christ cruel or false, a wine-bibber,
a glutton, or unclean.&nbsp; I feel at this moment as if I shall yet
come to ask Him at every meal, and at every other opportunity and temptation
of every kind, what He would have and what He would do before I go on
to take or to do anything myself.&nbsp; What a check, what a restraint,
what an awful scrupulosity that will henceforth work in me!&nbsp; But,
through that, what a pure, blameless, noble, holy and heavenly life
I shall then lead!&nbsp; What bodily pains, diseases, premature decays;
what mental remorses, what shames and scandals, what self-loathings
and what self-disgusts, what cups bitterer to drink than blood, I shall
then escape!&nbsp; Yes, O Paul, I shall henceforth hold with thee that
my body is the temple of Christ, and that I am not my own, but that
I am bought with a transporting price, and can, therefore, do nothing
less than glorify God in my body and in my spirit which are God&rsquo;s.&nbsp;
&lsquo;This place,&rsquo; says the Pauline author of the <i>Holy War</i>&mdash;&lsquo;This
place the King intended but for Himself alone, and not for another with
Him.&rsquo;</p>
<p>But, my brethren, lay this well, and as never before, to heart&mdash;this,
namely, that when you thus begin to keep any gate for Christ, your King
and Captain and Better-self,&mdash;Ear-gate, or Eye-gate, or Mouth-gate,
or any other gate&mdash;you will have taken up a task that shall have
no end with you in this life.&nbsp; Till you begin in dead earnest to
watch your heart, and all the doors of your heart, as if you were watching
Christ&rsquo;s heart for Him and all the doors of His heart, you will
have no idea of the arduousness and the endurance, the sleeplessness
and the self-denial, of the undertaking.</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Mansoul!&nbsp; Her wars seemed endless in her
eyes;<br />
She&rsquo;s lost by one, becomes another&rsquo;s prize.<br />
Mansoul!&nbsp; Her mighty wars, they did portend<br />
Her weal or woe and that world without end.<br />
Wherefore she must be more concern&rsquo;d than they<br />
Whose fears begin and end the self-same day.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;We all thought one battle would decide it,&rsquo; says Richard
Baxter, writing about the Civil War.&nbsp; &lsquo;But we were all very
much mistaken,&rsquo; sardonically adds Carlyle.&nbsp; Yes; and you
will be very much mistaken too if you enter on the war with sin in your
soul, in your senses and in your members, with powder and shot for one
engagement only.&nbsp; When you enlist here, lay well to heart that
it is for life.&nbsp; There is no discharge in this war.&nbsp; There
are no ornamental old pensioners here.&nbsp; It is a warfare for eternal
life, and nothing will end it but the end of your evil days on earth.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER III&mdash;EAR-GATE</h2>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Take heed what ye hear.&rsquo;&mdash;<i>Our Lord
in Mark</i>.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Take heed how you hear.&rsquo;&mdash;<i>Our Lord in Luke</i>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This famous town of Mansoul had five gates, in at which to come,
out at which to go, and these were made likewise answerable to the walls&mdash;to
wit, impregnable, and such as could never be opened nor forced but by
the will and leave of those within.&nbsp; &lsquo;The names of the gates
were these, Ear-gate, Eye-gate,&rsquo; and so on.&nbsp; Dr. George Wilson,
who was once Professor of Technology in our University, took this suggestive
passage out of the <i>Holy War</i> and made it the text of his famous
lecture in the Philosophical Institution, and then he printed the passage
on the fly-leaf of his delightful book <i>The Five Gateways of Knowledge</i>.&nbsp;
That is a book to read sometime, but this evening is to be spent with
the master.</p>
<p>For, after all, no one can write at once so beautifully, so quaintly,
so suggestively, and so evangelically as John Bunyan.&nbsp; &lsquo;The
Lord Willbewill,&rsquo; says John Bunyan, &lsquo;took special care that
the gates should be secured with double guards, double bolts, and double
locks and bars; and that Ear-gate especially might the better be looked
to, for that was the gate in at which the King&rsquo;s forces sought
most to enter.&nbsp; The Lord Willbewill therefore made old Mr. Prejudice,
an angry and ill-conditioned fellow, captain of the ward at that gate,
and put under his power sixty men, called Deafmen; men advantageous
for that service, forasmuch as they mattered no words of the captain
nor of the soldiers.&nbsp; And first the King&rsquo;s officers made
their force more formidable against Ear-gate: for they knew that unless
they could penetrate that no good could be done upon the town.&nbsp;
This done, they put the rest of their men in their places; after which
they gave out the word, which was, Ye must be born again!&nbsp; And
so the battle began.&nbsp; Now, they in the town had planted upon the
tower over Ear-gate two great guns, the one called High-mind and the
other Heady.&nbsp; Unto these two guns they trusted much; they were
cast in the castle by Diabolus&rsquo;s ironfounder, whose name was Mr.
Puff-up, and mischievous pieces they were.&nbsp; They in the camp also
did stoutly, for they saw that unless they could open Ear-gate it would
be in vain to batter the wall.&rsquo;&nbsp; And so on, through many
allegorical, and, if sometimes somewhat laboured, yet always eloquent,
pungent, and heart-exposing pages.</p>
<p>With these for our text let us now take a rapid glance at what some
of the more Bunyan-like passages in the prophets and the psalms say
about the ear; how it is kept and how it is lost; how it is used and
how it is abused.</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; The Psalmist uses a very striking expression in the 94th
Psalm when he is calling for justice, and is teaching God&rsquo;s providence
over men.&nbsp; &lsquo;He that planted the ear,&rsquo; the Psalmist
exclaims, &lsquo;shall he not hear?&rsquo;&nbsp; And, considering his
church and his day, that is not a bad remark of Cardinal Bellarmine
on that psalm,&mdash;&lsquo;the Psalmist&rsquo;s word <i>planted</i>,&rsquo;
says that able churchman, &lsquo;implies design, in that the ear was
not spontaneously evolved by an act of vital force, but was independently
created by God for a certain object, just as a tree, not of indigenous
growth, is of set purpose planted in some new place by the hand of man.&rsquo;&nbsp;
The same thing is said in Genesis, you remember, about the Garden of
Eden,&mdash;the Lord planted it and put the man and the woman, whose
ears he had just planted also, into the garden to dress it and keep
it.&nbsp; How they dressed the garden and kept it, and how they held
the gate of their ear against him who squatted down before it with his
innuendoes and his lies, we all know to our as yet unrepaired, though
not always irreparable, cost.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; One would almost think that the scornful apostle had the
Garden of Eden in his eye when he speaks so bitterly to Timothy of a
class of people who are cursed with &lsquo;itching ears.&rsquo;&nbsp;
Eve&rsquo;s ears itched unappeasably for the devil&rsquo;s promised
secret; and we have all inherited our first mother&rsquo;s miserable
curiosity.&nbsp; How eager, how restless, how importunate, we all are
to hear that new thing that does not at all concern us; or only concerns
us to our loss and our shame.&nbsp; And the more forbidden that secret
is to us, and the more full of inward evil to us&mdash;insane sinners
that we are&mdash;the more determined we are to get at it.&nbsp; Let
any forbidden secret be in the keeping of some one within earshot of
us and we will give him no rest till he has shared the evil thing with
us.&nbsp; Let any specially evil page be published in a newspaper, and
we will take good care that that day&rsquo;s paper is not thrown into
the waste-basket; we will hide it away, like a dog with a stolen bone,
till we are able to dig it up and chew it dry in secret.&nbsp; The devil
has no need to blockade or besiege the gate of our ear if he has any
of his good things to offer us.&nbsp; The gate that can only be opened
from within will open at once of itself if he or any of his newsmongers
but squat down for a moment before it.&nbsp; Shame on us, and on all
of us, for our itching ears.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; Isaiah speaks of some men in his day whose ears were &lsquo;heavy&rsquo;
and whose hearts were fat, and the Psalmist speaks of some men in his
day whose ears were &lsquo;stopped&rsquo; up altogether.&nbsp; And there
is not a better thing in Bunyan at his very best than that surly old
churl called Prejudice, so ill-conditioned and so always on the edge
of anger.&nbsp; By the devil&rsquo;s plan of battle old Prejudice was
appointed to be warder of Ear-gate, and to enable him to keep that gate
for his master he had sixty deaf men put under him, men most advantageous
for that post, forasmuch as it mattered not to them what Emmanuel and
His officers said.&nbsp; There could be no manner of doubt who composed
that inimitable passage.&nbsp; There is all the truth and all the humour
and all the satire in Old Prejudice that our author has accustomed us
to in his best pieces.&nbsp; The common people always get the best literature
along with the best religion in John Bunyan.&nbsp; &lsquo;They are like
the deaf adder that stoppeth her ear, and which will not hearken to
the voice of charmers charming never so wisely,&rsquo; says the Psalmist,
speaking about some bad men in his day.&nbsp; Now, I will not stand
upon David&rsquo;s natural history here, but his moral and religious
meaning is evident enough.&nbsp; David is not concerned about adders
and their ears, he is wholly taken up with us and our adder-like animosity
against the truth.&nbsp; Against what teacher, then; against what preacher;
against what writer; against what doctrine, reproof, correction, has
your churlish prejudice adder-like shut your ear?&nbsp; Against what
truth, human or divine, have you hitherto stopped up your ear like the
Psalmist&rsquo;s serpent?&nbsp; To ask that boldly, honestly, and in
the sight of God, at yourself to-night, would end in making you the
lifelong friend of some preacher, some teacher, some soul-saving truth
you have up till to-night been prejudiced against with the rooted prejudice
and the sullen obstinacy of sixty deaf men.&nbsp; O God, help us to
lay aside all this adder-like antipathy at men and things, both in public
and in private life.&nbsp; Help us to give all men and all causes a
fair field and no favour, but the field and the favour of an open and
an honest mind, and a simple and a sincere heart.&nbsp; He that hath
ears, let him hear!</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; As we work our way through the various developments and
vicissitudes of the Holy War we shall find Ear-gate in it and in ourselves
passing through many unexpected experiences; now held by one side and
now by another.&nbsp; And we find the same succession of vicissitudes
set forth in Holy Scripture.&nbsp; If you pay any attention to what
you read and hear, and then begin to ask yourselves fair in the face
as to your own prejudices, prepossessions, animosities, and antipathies,&mdash;you
will at once begin to reap your reward in having put into your possession
what the Scriptures so often call an &lsquo;inclined&rsquo; ear.&nbsp;
That is to say, an ear not only unstopped, not only unloaded, but actually
prepared and predisposed to all manner of truth and goodness.&nbsp;
Around our city there are the remains, the still visible tracks, of
roads that at one time took the country people into our city, but which
are now stopped up and made wholly impassable.&nbsp; There is no longer
any road into Edinburgh that way.&nbsp; There are other roads still
open, but they are very roundabout, and at best very uphill.&nbsp; And
then there are other roads so smooth, and level, and broad, and well
kept, that they are full of all kinds of traffic; in the centre carts
and carriages crowd them, on the one side horses and their riders delight
to display themselves, and on the other side pedestrians and perambulators
enjoy the sun.&nbsp; And then there are still other roads with such
a sweet and gentle incline upon them that it is a positive pleasure
both to man and beast to set their foot upon them.&nbsp; And so it is
with the minds and the hearts of the men and the women who crowd these
roads.&nbsp; Just as the various roads are, so are the ears and the
understandings, the affections and the inclinations of those who walk
and ride and drive upon them.&nbsp; Some of those men&rsquo;s ears are
impassably stopped up by self-love, self-interest, party-spirit, anger,
envy, and ill-will,&mdash;impenetrably stopped up against all the men
and all the truths of earth and of heaven that would instruct, enlighten,
convict or correct them.&nbsp; Some men&rsquo;s minds, again, are not
so much shut up as they are crooked, and warped, and narrow, and full
of obstruction and opposition.&nbsp; Whereas here and there, sometimes
on horseback and sometimes on foot; sometimes a learned man walking
out of the city to take the air, and sometimes an unlettered countryman
coming into the city to make his market, will have his ear hospitably
open to every good man he meets, to every good book he reads, to every
good paper he buys at the street corner, and to every good speech, and
report, and letter, and article he reads in it.&nbsp; And how happy
that man is, how happy his house is at home, and how happy he makes
all those he but smiles to on his afternoon walk, and in all his walk
along the roads of this life.&nbsp; Never see an I incline&rsquo; on
a railway or on a driving or a walking road without saying on it before
you leave it, &lsquo;I waited patiently for the Lord, and He inclined
His ear unto me and heard my cry.&nbsp; Because He hath inclined His
ear unto me, therefore will I call upon Him as long as I live.&nbsp;
Incline not my heart to any evil thing, to practise wicked works with
them that work iniquity.&nbsp; Incline my heart unto Thy testimonies,
and not to covetousness.&nbsp; I have inclined mine heart to perform
Thy statutes alway, even unto the end.&rsquo;</p>
<p>5.&nbsp; Shakespeare speaks in <i>Richard the Second</i> of &lsquo;the
open ear of youth,&rsquo; and it is a beautiful truth in a beautiful
passage.&nbsp; Young men, who are still young men, keep your ears open
to all truth and to all duty and to all goodness, and shut your ears
with an adder&rsquo;s determination against all that which ruined Richard&mdash;flattering
sounds, reports of fashions, and lascivious metres.&nbsp; &lsquo;Our
souls would only be gainers by the perfection of our bodies were they
wisely dealt with,&rsquo; says Professor Wilson in his <i>Five Gateways</i>.&nbsp;
&lsquo;And for every human being we should aim at securing, so far as
they can be attained, an eye as keen and piercing as that of the eagle;
an ear as sensitive to the faintest sound as that of the hare; a nostril
as far-scenting as that of the wild deer; a tongue as delicate as that
of the butterfly; and a touch as acute as that of the spider.&nbsp;
No man ever was so endowed, and no man ever will be; but all men come
infinitely short of what they should achieve were they to make their
senses what they might be made.&nbsp; The old have outlived their opportunity,
and the diseased never had it; but the young, who have still an undimmed
eye, an undulled ear, and a soft hand; an unblunted nostril, and a tongue
which tastes with relish the plainest fare&mdash;the young can so cultivate
their senses as to make the narrow ring, which for the old and the infirm
encircles things sensible, widen for them into an almost limitless horizon.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Take heed what you hear, and take heed how you hear.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER IV&mdash;EYE-GATE</h2>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Mine eye affecteth mine heart.&rsquo;&mdash;<i>Jeremiah</i>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&lsquo;Think, in the first place,&rsquo; says the eloquent author
of the <i>Five Gateways of Knowledge</i>, &lsquo;how beautiful the human
eye is.&nbsp; The eyes of many of the lower animals are, doubtless,
very beautiful.&nbsp; You must all have admired the bold, fierce, bright
eye of the eagle; the large, gentle, brown eye of the ox; the treacherous,
green eye of the cat, waxing and waning like the moon; the pert eye
of the sparrow; the sly eye of the fox; the peering little bead of black
enamel in the mouse&rsquo;s head; the gem-like eye that redeems the
toad from ugliness, and the intelligent, affectionate expression which
looks out of the human-like eye of the horse and dog.&nbsp; There are
many other animals whose eyes are full of beauty, but there is a glory
that excelleth in the eye of a man.&nbsp; We realise this best when
we gaze into the eyes of those we love.&nbsp; It is their eyes we look
at when we are near them, and it is their eyes we recall when we are
far away from them.&nbsp; The face is all but a blank without the eye;
the eye seems to concentrate every feature in itself.&nbsp; It is the
eye that smiles, not the lips; it is the eye that listens, not the ear;
it is the eye that frowns, not the brow; it is the eye that mourns,
not the voice.&nbsp; The eye sees what it brings the power to see.&nbsp;
How true is this!&nbsp; The sailor on the look-out can see a ship where
the landsman can see nothing.&nbsp; The Esquimaux can distinguish a
white fox among the white snow.&nbsp; The astronomer can see a star
in the sky where to others the blue expanse is unbroken.&nbsp; The shepherd
can distinguish the face of every single sheep in his flock,&rsquo;
so Professor Wilson.&nbsp; And then Dr. Gould tells us in his mystico-evolutionary,
Behmen-and-Darwin book, <i>The Meaning and the Method of Life</i>&mdash;a
book which those will read who can and ought&mdash;that the eye is the
most psychical, the most spiritual, the most useful, and the most valued
and cherished of all the senses; after which he adds this wonderful
and heart-affecting scientific fact, that in death by starvation, every
particle of fat in the body is auto-digested except the cream-cushion
of the eye-ball!&nbsp; So true is it that the eye is the mistress, the
queen, and the most precious, to Creator and creature alike, of all
the five senses.</p>
<p>Now, in the <i>Holy War</i> John Bunyan says a thing about the ear,
as distinguished from the eye, that I cannot subscribe to in my own
experience at any rate.&nbsp; In describing the terrible war that raged
round Ear-gate, and finally swept up through that gate and into the
streets of the city, he says that the ear is the shortest and the surest
road to the heart.&nbsp; I confess I cannot think that to be the actual
case.&nbsp; I am certain that it is not so in my own case.&nbsp; My
eye is very much nearer my heart than my ear is.&nbsp; My eye much sooner
affects, and much more powerfully affects, my heart than my ear ever
does.&nbsp; Not only is my eye by very much the shortest road to my
heart, but, like all other short roads, it is cram-full of all kinds
of traffic when my ear stands altogether empty.&nbsp; My eye is constantly
crowded and choked with all kinds of commerce; whole hordes of immigrants
and invaders trample one another down on the congested street that leads
from my eye to my heart.&nbsp; Speaking for myself, for one assault
that is made on my heart through my ear there are a thousand assaults
successfully made through my eye.&nbsp; Indeed, were my eye but stopped
up; had I but obedience and courage and self-mortification enough to
pluck both my eyes out, that would be half the cleansing and healing
and holiness of my evil heart; or at least, the half of its corruption,
rebellion, and abominable wickedness would henceforth be hidden from
me.&nbsp; I think I can see what led John Bunyan in his day and in this
book to make that too strong statement about the ear as against the
eye; but it is not like him to have let such an over-statement stand
and continue in his corrected and carefully finished work.&nbsp; The
prophet Jeremiah, I feel satisfied, would not have subscribed to what
is said in the <i>Holy War</i> in extenuation of the eye.&nbsp; That
heart-broken prophet does not say that it has been his ear that has
made his head waters.&nbsp; It is his eye, he says, that has so affected
his heart.&nbsp; The Prophet of the Captivity had all the <i>Holy War</i>
potentially in his imagination when he penned that so suggestive sentence.&nbsp;
And the Latin poet of experience, the grown-up man&rsquo;s own poet,
says somewhere that the things that enter by his eye seize and hold
his heart much more swiftly and much more surely than those things that
but enter by his ear.&nbsp; I shall continue, then, to hold by my text,
&lsquo;Mine eye affecteth mine heart.&rsquo;</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; Turning then, to the prophets and proverb-makers of Israel,
and then to the New Testament for the true teaching on the eye, I come,
in the first place, on that so pungent saying of Solomon that &lsquo;the
eyes of a fool are in the ends of the earth.&rsquo;&nbsp; Look at that
born fool, says Solomon, who has his eyes and his heart committed to
him to keep.&nbsp; See him how he gapes and stares after everything
that does not concern him, and lets the door of his own heart stand
open to every entering thief.&nbsp; London is a city of three million
inhabitants, and they are mostly fools, Carlyle once said.&nbsp; And
let him in this city whose eyes keep at home cast the first stone at
those foreign fools.&nbsp; I will wager on their side that many of you
here to-night know better what went on in Mashonaland last week than
what went on in your own kitchen downstairs, or in your own nursery
or schoolroom upstairs.&nbsp; Some of you are ten times more taken up
with the prospects of Her Majesty&rsquo;s Government this session, and
with the plots of Her Majesty&rsquo;s Opposition, than you are with
the prospects of the good and the evil, and the plots of God and the
devil, all this winter in your own hearts.&nbsp; You rise early, and
make a fight to get the first of the newspaper; but when the minister
comes in in the afternoon you blush because the housemaid has mislaid
the Bible.&nbsp; Did you ever read of the stargazer who fell into an
open well at the street corner?&nbsp; Like him, you may be a great astronomer,
a great politician, a great theologian, a great defender of the faith
even, and yet may be a stark fool just in keeping the doors and the
windows of your own heart.&nbsp; &lsquo;You shall see a poor soul,&rsquo;
says Dr. Goodwin, &lsquo;mean in abilities of wit, or accomplishments
of learning, who knows not how the world goes, nor upon what wheels
its states turn, who yet knows more clearly and experimentally his own
heart than all the learned men in the world know theirs.&nbsp; And though
the other may better discourse philosophically of the acts of the soul,
yet this poor man sees more into the corruption of it than they all.&rsquo;&nbsp;
And in another excellent place he says: &lsquo;Many who have leisure
and parts to read much, instead of ballasting their hearts with divine
truth, and building up their souls with its precious words, are much
more versed in play-books, jeering pasquils, romances, and feigned staves,
which are but apes and peacocks&rsquo; feathers instead of pearls and
precious stones.&nbsp; Foreign and foolish discourses please their eyes
and their ears; they are more chameleons than men, for they live on
the east wind.&rsquo;</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; &lsquo;If thine eye offend thee&rsquo;&mdash;our Lord lays
down this law to all those who would enter into life&mdash;&lsquo;pluck
it out and cast it from thee; for it is better for thee to enter into
life with one eye, rather than, having two eyes, to be cast into hell-fire.&rsquo;&nbsp;
Does your eye offend you, my brethren?&nbsp; Does your eye cause you
to stumble and fall, as it is in the etymology?&nbsp; The right use
of the eye is to keep you from stumbling and falling; but so perverted
are the eye and the heart of every sinner that the city watchman has
become a partaker with thieves, and our trusted guide and guardian a
traitor and a knave.&nbsp; If thine eye, therefore, offends thee; if
it places a stone or a tree in thy way in a dark night; if it digs a
deep ditch right across thy way home; if it in any way leads thee astray,
or lets in upon thee thine enemies&mdash;then, surely, thou wert better
to be without that eye altogether.&nbsp; Pluck it out, then; or, what
is still harder to go on all your days doing, pluck the evil thing out
of it.&nbsp; Shut up that book and put it away.&nbsp; Throw that paper
and that picture into the fire.&nbsp; Cut off that companion, even if
he were an adoring lover.&nbsp; Refuse that entertainment and that amusement,
though all the world were crowding upto it.&nbsp; And soon, and soon,
till you have plucked your eye as clean of temptations and snares as
it is possible to be in this life.&nbsp; For this life is full of that
terrible but blessed law of our Lord.&nbsp; The life of all His people,
that is; and you are one of them, are you not?&nbsp; You will know whether
or no you are one of them just by the number of the beautiful things,
and the sweet things, and the things to be desired, that you have plucked
out of your eye at His advice and demand.&nbsp; True religion, my brethren,
on some sides of it, and at some stages of it, is a terribly severe
and sore business; and unless it is proving a terribly severe and sore
business to you, look out! lest, with your two hands and your two feet
and your two eyes, you be cast, with all that your hands and feet and
eyes have feasted on, into the everlasting fires!&nbsp; Woe unto the
world because of offences, but woe much more to that member and entrance-gate
of the body by which the offence cometh!&nbsp; Wherefore, if thine eye
offend thee&mdash;!</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; &lsquo;Let thine eyes look right on, and let thine eyelids
look straight before thee.&rsquo;&nbsp; Now, if you wish both to preserve
your eyes, and to escape the everlasting fires at the same time, attend
to this text.&nbsp; For this is almost as good as plucking out your
two eyes; indeed, it is almost the very same thing.&nbsp; Solomon shall
speak to the man in this house to-night who has the most inflammable,
the most ungovernable, and the most desperately wicked heart.&nbsp;
You, man, with that heart, you know that you cannot pass up the street
without your eye becoming a perfect hell-gate of lust, of hate, of ill-will,
of resentment and of revenge.&nbsp; Your eye falls on a man, on a woman,
on a house, on a shop, on a school, on a church, on a carriage, on a
cart, on an innocent child&rsquo;s perambulator even; and, devil let
loose that you are, your eye fills your heart on the spot with absolute
hell-fire.&nbsp; Your presence and your progress poison the very streets
of the city.&nbsp; And that, not as the short-sighted and the vulgar
will read Solomon&rsquo;s plain-spoken Scripture, with the poison of
lewdness and uncleanness, but with the still more malignant, stealthy,
and deadly poison of social, professional, political, and ecclesiastical
hatred, resentment, and ill-will.&nbsp; Whoredom and wine openly slay
their thousands on all our streets; but envy and spite, dislike and
hatred their ten thousands.&nbsp; The fact is, we would never know how
malignantly wicked our hearts are but for our eyes.&nbsp; But a sudden
spark, a single flash through the eye falling on the gunpowder that
fills our hearts, that lets us know a hundred times every day what at
heart we are made of.&nbsp; &lsquo;Of a verity, O Lord, I am made of
sin, and that my life maketh manifest,&rsquo; prays Bishop Andrewes
every day.&nbsp; Why, sir, not to go to the street, the direction in
which your eyes turn in this house this evening will make this house
a very &lsquo;den,&rsquo; as our Lord said&mdash;yes, a very den to
you of temptation and transgression.&nbsp; My son, let thine eyes look
right on.&nbsp; Ponder the path of thy feet, turn not to the right hand
nor to the left&mdash;remove thy foot from all evil!</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; There is still another eye that is almost as good as an
eye out altogether, and that is a Job&rsquo;s eye.&nbsp; Job was the
first author of that eye and all we who have that excellent eye take
it of him.&nbsp; &lsquo;I have made a covenant with mine eyes,&rsquo;
said that extraordinary man&mdash;that extraordinarily able, honest,
exposed and exercised man.&nbsp; Now, you must all know what a covenant
is.&nbsp; A covenant is a compact, a contract, an agreement, an engagement.&nbsp;
In a covenant two parties come to terms with one another.&nbsp; The
two covenanters strike hands, and solemnly engage themselves to one
another: I will do this for you if you will do that for me.&nbsp; It
is a bargain, says the other; let us have it sealed with wax and signed
with pen and ink before two witnesses.&nbsp; As, for instance, at the
Lord&rsquo;s Table.&nbsp; I swear, you say, over the Body and the Blood
of the Son of God, I swear to make a covenant with mine eyes.&nbsp;
I will never let them read again that idle, infidel, scoffing, unclean
sheet.&nbsp; I will not let them look on any of my former images or
imaginations of forbidden pleasures.&nbsp; I swear, O Thou to whom the
night shineth as the day, that I will never again say, Surely the darkness
shall cover me!&nbsp; See if I do not henceforth by Thy grace keep my
feet off every slippery street.&nbsp; That, and many other things like
that, was the way that Job made his so noble covenant with his eyes
in his day and in his land.&nbsp; And it was because he so made and
so kept his covenant that God so boasted over him and said, Hast thou
considered my servant Job?&nbsp; And then, every covenant has its two
sides.&nbsp; The other side of Job&rsquo;s covenant, of which God Himself
was the surety, you can read and think over in your solitary lodgings
to-night.&nbsp; Read Job xxxi. 1, and then Job xl. to the end, and then
be sure you take covenant paper and ink to God before you sleep.&nbsp;
And let all fashionable young ladies hear what Miss Rossetti expects
for herself, and for all of her sex with her who shall subscribe her
covenant.&nbsp; &lsquo;True,&rsquo; she admits, &lsquo;all our life
long we shall be bound to refrain our soul, and keep it low; but what
then?&nbsp; For the books we now refrain to read we shall one day be
endowed with wisdom and knowledge.&nbsp; For the music we will not listen
to we shall join in the song of the redeemed.&nbsp; For the pictures
from which we turn we shall gaze unabashed on the Beatific Vision.&nbsp;
For the companionship we shun we shall be welcomed into angelic society
and the communion of triumphant saints.&nbsp; For the amusements we
avoid we shall keep the supreme jubilee.&nbsp; For all the pleasures
we miss we shall abide, and for evermore abide, in the rapture of heaven.&rsquo;</p>
<p>5.&nbsp; And then there is the Pauline eye.&nbsp; An eye, however,
that Job would have shared with Paul and with the Corinthian Church
had the patriarch been privileged to live in our New Testament day.&nbsp;
Ever since the Holy Ghost with His anointing oil fell on us at Pentecost,
says the apostle, we have had an eye by means of which we look not at
the things that are seen, but at the things that are not seen.&nbsp;
Now, he who has an eye like that is above both plucking out his eyes
or making a covenant with them either.&nbsp; It is like what Paul says
about the law also.&nbsp; The law is not made for a righteous man.&nbsp;
A righteous man is above the law and independent of it.&nbsp; The law
does not reach to him and he is not hampered with it.&nbsp; And so it
is with the man who has got Paul&rsquo;s splendid eyes for the unseen.&nbsp;
He does not need to touch so much as one of his eye-lashes to pluck
them out.&nbsp; For his eyes are blind, and his ears are deaf, and his
whole body is dead to the things that are temporal.&nbsp; His eyes are
inwardly ablaze with the things that are eternal.&nbsp; He whose eyes
have been opened to the truth and the love of his Bible, he will gloat
no more over your books and your papers filled with lies, and slander,
and spite, and lewdness!&nbsp; He who has his conversation in heaven
does not need to set a watch on his lips lest he take up an ill report
about his neighbour.&nbsp; He who walks every day on the streets of
gold will step as swiftly as may be, with girt loins, and with a preoccupied
eye, out of the slippery and unsavoury streets of this forsaken earth.&nbsp;
He who has fast working out for him an exceeding and eternal weight
of glory will easily count all his cups and all his crosses, and all
the crooks in his lot but as so many light afflictions and but for a
moment.&nbsp; My Lord Understanding had his palace built with high perspective
towers on it, and the site of it was near to Eye-gate, from the top
of which his lordship every day looked not at the things which are temporal,
but at the things which are eternal, and down from his palace towers
he every day descended to administer his heavenly office in the city.</p>
<p>Your eye, then, is the shortest way into your heart.&nbsp; Watch
it well, therefore; suspect and challenge all outsiders who come near
it.&nbsp; Keep the passes that lead to your heart with all diligence.&nbsp;
Let nothing contraband, let nothing that even looks suspicious, ever
enter your hearts; for, if it once enters, and turns out to be evil,
you will never get it all out again as long as you live.&nbsp; &lsquo;Death
is come up into our windows,&rsquo; says our prophet in another place,
&lsquo;and is entered into our palaces, to cut off our children in our
houses and our young men in our streets.&rsquo;&nbsp; Make a covenant,
then, with your eyes.&nbsp; Take an oath of your eyes as to which way
they are henceforth to look.&nbsp; For, let them look this way, and
your heart is immediately full of lust, and hate, and envy, and ill-will.&nbsp;
On the other hand, lead them to look that way and your heart is as immediately
full of truth and beauty, brotherly kindness and charity.&nbsp; The
light of the body is the eye; if, therefore, thine eye be single, thy
whole body shall be full of light; but if thine eye be evil, thy whole
body is full of darkness.&nbsp; If, therefore, the light that is in
thee be darkness, how great is that darkness!</p>
<h2>CHAPTER V&mdash;THE KING&rsquo;S PALACE</h2>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;The palace is not for man, but for the Lord God.&rsquo;&mdash;<i>David</i>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&lsquo;Now, there is in this gallant country a fair and delicate
town, a corporation, called Mansoul: a town for its building so curious,
for its situation so commodious, for its privileges so advantageous,
that I may say of it, there is not its equal under the whole heaven.&nbsp;
Also, there was reared up in the midst of this town a most famous and
stately palace: for strength, it might be called a castle; for pleasantness,
a paradise; and for largeness, a place so copious as to contain all
the world.&nbsp; This place the King intended for Himself alone, and
not for another with Him, so great was His delight in it.&rsquo;&nbsp;
Thus far, our excellent allegorical author.&nbsp; But there are other
authors that treat of this great matter now in hand besides the allegorical
authors.&nbsp; You will hear tell sometimes about a class of authors
called the Mystics.&nbsp; Well, listen at this stage to one of them,
and one of the best of them, on this present matter&mdash;the human
heart, that is.&nbsp; &lsquo;Our heart,&rsquo; he says, &lsquo;is our
manner of existence, or the state in which we feel ourselves to be;
it is an inward life, a vital sensibility, which contains our manner
of feeling what and how we are; it is the state of our desires and tendencies,
of inwardly seeing, tasting, relishing, and feeling that which passes
within us; our heart is that to us inwardly with regard to ourselves
which our senses of seeing, hearing, feeling, and such like are with
regard to things that are without or external to us.&nbsp; Your heart
is the best and greatest gift of God to you.&nbsp; It is the highest,
greatest, strongest, and noblest power of your nature.&nbsp; It forms
your whole life, be it what it will.&nbsp; All evil and all good come
from your heart.&nbsp; Your heart alone has the key of life and death
for you.&rsquo;&nbsp; I was just about to ask you at this point which
of our two authors, our allegorical or our mystical author upon the
heart, you like best.&nbsp; But that would be a stupid and a wayward
question since you have them both before you, and both at their best,
to possess and to enjoy.&nbsp; To go back then to John Bunyan, and to
his allegory of the human heart.</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; To begin with, then, there was reared up in the midst of
this town of Mansoul a most famous and stately palace.&nbsp; And that
palace and the town immediately around it were the mirror and the glory
of all that its founder and maker had ever made.&nbsp; His palace was
his very top-piece.&nbsp; It was the metropolitan of the whole world
round about it; and it had positive commission and power to demand service
and support of all around.&nbsp; Yes.&nbsp; And all that is literally,
evidently, and actually true of the human heart.&nbsp; For all other
earthly things are created and upheld, are ordered and administered,
with an eye to the human heart.&nbsp; The human heart is the final cause,
as our scholars would say, of absolutely all other earthly things.&nbsp;
Earth, air, water; light and heat; all the successively existing worlds,
mineral, vegetable, animal, spiritual; grass, herbs, corn, fruit-trees,
cattle and sheep, and all other living creatures; all are upheld for
the use and the support of man.&nbsp; And, then, all that is in man
himself is in him for the end and the use of his heart.&nbsp; All his
bodily senses; all his bodily members; every fearfully and wonderfully
made part of his body and of his mind; all administer to his heart.&nbsp;
She is the sovereign and sits supreme.&nbsp; And she is worthy and is
fully entitled so to sit.&nbsp; For there is nothing on the earth greater
or better than the heart, unless it is the Creator Himself, who planned
and executed the heart for Himself and not for another with Him.&nbsp;
&lsquo;The body exists,&rsquo; says a philosophical biologist of our
day, &lsquo;to furnish the cerebral centres with prepared food, just
as the vegetable world, viewed biologically, exists to furnish the animal
world with similar food.&nbsp; The higher is the last formed, the most
difficult, and the most complex; but it is just this that is most precious
and significant&mdash;all of which shows His unrolling purpose.&nbsp;
It is the last that alone explains all that went before, and it is the
coming that will alone explain the present.&nbsp; God before all, through
all, foreseeing all, and still preparing all; God in all is profoundly
evident.&rsquo;&nbsp; Yes, profoundly evident to profound minds, and
experimentally and sweetly evident to religious minds, and to renewed
and loving and holy hearts.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; For fame and for state a palace, while for strength it might
be called a castle.&nbsp; In sufficiently ancient times the king&rsquo;s
palace was always a castle also.&nbsp; David&rsquo;s palace on Mount
Zion was as much a military fortress as a royal residence; and King
Priam&rsquo;s palace was the protection both of itself and of the whole
of the country around.&nbsp; In those wild times great men built their
houses on high places, and then the weak and endangered people gathered
around the strongholds of the powerful, as we see in our own city.&nbsp;
Our own steep and towering rock invited to its top the castle-builder
of a remote age, and then the exposed country around began to gather
itself together under the shelter of the bourg.&nbsp; And thus it is
that the military engineering of the <i>Holy War</i> makes that old
allegorical book most excellent to read, not only for common men like
you and me, who are bent on the fortification and the defence of our
own hearts, but for the military historians of those old times also,
for the experts of to-day also, and for all good students of fortification.&nbsp;
And the New Testament of the Divine peace itself, as well as the Old
Testament so full of the wars of the Lord&mdash;they both support and
serve as an encouragement and an example to our spiritual author in
the elaboration of his military allegory.&nbsp; Every good soldier of
Jesus Christ has by heart the noble paradox of Paul to the Philippians&mdash;that
the peace of God which passeth all understanding shall keep their hearts
and minds through Christ Jesus.&nbsp; Let God&rsquo;s peace, he says,
be your man of war.&nbsp; Let His surpassing peace do both the work
of war and the work of peace also in your hearts and in your minds.&nbsp;
Let that peace both fortify with walls, and garrison with soldiers,
and watch every gate, and hold every street and lane of your hearts
and of your minds all around your hearts.&nbsp; And all through the
Prince of Peace, the Captain of all Holy War, Jesus Christ Himself.&nbsp;
No wonder, then, that in a strength&mdash;in a kind and in a degree
of strength&mdash;that passeth all understanding, this stately palace
of the heart is also here called a well-garrisoned castle.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; And then for pleasantness the human heart is a perfect paradise.&nbsp;
For pleasantness the human heart is like those famous royal parks of
Nineveh and Babylon that sprang up in after days as if to recover and
restore the Garden of Eden that had been lost to those eastern lands.&nbsp;
But even Adam&rsquo;s own paradise was but a poor outside imitation
in earth and water, in flowers and fruits, of the far better paradise
God had planted within him.&nbsp; Take another Mystic at this point
upon paradise.&nbsp; &lsquo;My dear man,&rsquo; exclaims Jacob Behmen,
&lsquo;the Garden of Eden is not paradise, neither does Moses say so.&nbsp;
Paradise is the divine joy, and that was in their own hearts so long
as they stood in the love of God.&nbsp; Paradise is the divine and angelical
joy, pure love, pure joy, pure gladness, in which there is no fear,
no misery, and no death.&nbsp; Which paradise neither death nor the
devil can touch.&nbsp; And yet it has no stone wall around it; only
a great gulf which no man or angel can cross but by that new birth of
which Christ spoke to Nicodemus.&nbsp; Reason asks, Where is paradise
to be found?&nbsp; Is it far off or near?&nbsp; Is it in this world
or is it above the stars?&nbsp; Where is that desirable native country
where there is no death?&nbsp; Beloved, there is nothing nearer you
at this moment than paradise, if you incline that way.&nbsp; God beckons
you back into paradise at this moment, and calls you by name to come.&nbsp;
Come, He says, and be one of My paradise children.&nbsp; In paradise,&rsquo;
the Teutonic Philosopher goes on, &lsquo;there is nothing but hearty
love, a meek and a gentle love; a most friendly and most courteous discourse:
a gracious, amiable, and blessed society, where the one is always glad
to see the other, and to honour the other.&nbsp; They know of no malice
in paradise, no cunning, no subtlety, and no sly deceit.&nbsp; But the
fruits of the Spirit of God are common among them in paradise, and one
may make use of all the good things of paradise without causing disfavour,
or hatred, or envy, for there is no contrary affection there, but all
hearts there are knit together in love.&nbsp; In paradise they love
one another, and rejoice in the beauty, loveliness, and gladness of
one another.&nbsp; No one esteems or accounts himself more excellent
than another in paradise; but every one has great joy in another, and
rejoices in another&rsquo;s fair beauty, whence their love to one another
continually increases, so that they lead one another by the hand, and
so friendly kiss one another.&rsquo;&nbsp; Thus the blessed Behmen saw
paradise and had it in his heart as he sat over his hammer and lapstone
in his solitary stall.&nbsp; For of such as Jacob Behmen and John Bunyan
is the kingdom of heaven, and all such saintly souls have paradise restored
again and improved upon in their own hearts.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; And for largeness a place so copious as to contain all the
world.&nbsp; Over against the word &lsquo;copious&rsquo; Bunyan hangs
for a key, Ecclesiastes third and eleventh; and under it Miss Peacock
adds this as a note&mdash;&lsquo;<i>Copious</i>, spacious.&nbsp; Old
French, <i>copieux</i>; Latin, <i>copiosus</i>, plentiful.&rsquo;&nbsp;
The human heart, as we have already read to-night, is the highest, greatest,
strongest, and noblest part of human nature.&nbsp; And so it is.&nbsp;
Fearfully and wonderfully made as is the whole of human nature, that
fear and that wonder surpass themselves in the spaciousness and the
copiousness of the human heart.&nbsp; For what is it that the human
heart has not space for, and to spare?&nbsp; After the whole world is
received home into a human heart, there is room, and, indeed, hunger,
for another world, and after that for still another.&nbsp; The sun is&mdash;I
forget how many times bigger than our whole world, and yet we can open
our heart and take down the sun into it, and shut him out again and
restore him to his immeasurable distances in the heavens, and all in
the twinkling of an eye.&nbsp; As for instance.&nbsp; As I wrote these
lines I read a report of a lecture by Sir Robert Ball in which that
distinguished astronomer discoursed on recent solar discoveries.&nbsp;
A globe of coal, Sir Robert said, as big as our earth, and all set ablaze
at the same moment, would not give out so much heat to the worlds around
as the sun gives out in a thousandth part of a second.&nbsp; Well, as
I read that, and ere ever I was aware what was going on, my heart had
opened over my newspaper, and the sun had swept down from the sky, and
had rushed into my heart, and before I knew where I was the cry had
escaped my lips, &lsquo;Great and marvellous are Thy works, Lord God
Almighty!&nbsp; Who shall not fear Thee and glorify thy name?&rsquo;&nbsp;
And then this reflection as suddenly came to me: How good it is to be
at peace with God, and to be able and willing to say, My Father!&nbsp;
That the whole of the surging and flaming sun was actually down in my
straitened and hampered heart at that idle moment over my paper is scientifically
demonstrable; for only that which is in the heart of a man can kindle
the passions that are in the heart of that man; and nothing is more
sure to me than that the great passions of fear and love, wonder and
rapture were at that moment at a burning point within me.&nbsp; There
is a passage well on in the <i>Holy War</i>, which for terror and for
horror, and at the same time for truth and for power, equals anything
either in Dante or in Milton.&nbsp; Lucifer has stood up at the council
board to second the scheme of Beelzebub.&nbsp; &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; he
said, amid the plaudits of his fellow-princes&mdash;&lsquo;Yes, I swear
it.&nbsp; Let us fill Mansoul full with our abundance.&nbsp; Let us
make of this castle, as they vainly call it, a warehouse, as the name
is in some of their cities above.&nbsp; For if we can only get Mansoul
to fill herself full with much goods she is henceforth ours.&nbsp; My
peers,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;you all know His parable of how unblessed
riches choke the word; and, again, we know what happens when the hearts
of men are overcharged with surfeiting and with drunkenness.&nbsp; Let
us give them all that, then, to their heart&rsquo;s desire.&rsquo;&nbsp;
This advice of Lucifer, our history tells us, was highly applauded in
hell, and ever since it has proved their masterpiece to choke Mansoul
with the fulness of this world, and to surfeit the heart with the good
things thereof.&nbsp; But, my brethren, you will outwit hell herself
and all her counsellors and all her machinations, if, out of all the
riches, pleasures, cares, and possessions, that both heaven and earth
and hell can heap into your heart, those riches, pleasures, cares, and
possessions but produce corresponding passions and affections towards
God and man.&nbsp; Only let fear, and love, and thankfulness, and helpfulness
be kindled and fed to all their fulness in your heart, and all the world
and all that it contains will only leave the more room in your boundless
heart for God and for your brother.&nbsp; All that God has made, or
could make with all His counsel and all His power laid out, will not
fill your boundless and bottomless heart.&nbsp; He must come down and
come into your boundless and bottomless heart Himself.&nbsp; Himself:
your Father, your Redeemer, and your Sanctifier and Comforter also.&nbsp;
Let the whole universe try to fill your heart, O man of God, and after
it all we shall hear you singing in famine and in loneliness the doleful
ditty:</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;O come to my heart, Lord Jesus,<br />
There is room in my heart for Thee.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>5.&nbsp; &lsquo;Madame,&rsquo; said a holy solitary to Madame Guyon
in her misery&mdash;&lsquo;Madame, you are disappointed and perplexed
because you seek without what you have within.&nbsp; Accustom yourself
to seek for God in your own heart and you will always find Him there.&rsquo;&nbsp;
From that hour that gifted woman was a Mystic.&nbsp; The secret of the
interior life flashed upon her in a moment.&nbsp; She had been starving
in the midst of fulness; God was near and not far off; the kingdom of
heaven was within her.&nbsp; The love of God from that hour took possession
of her soul with an inexpressible happiness.&nbsp; Prayer, which had
before been so difficult, was now delightful and indispensable; hours
passed away like moments: she could scarcely cease from praying.&nbsp;
Her domestic trials seemed great to her no longer; her inward joy consumed
like a fire the reluctance, the murmur, and the sorrow, which all had
their birth in herself.&nbsp; A spirit of comforting peace, a sense
of rejoicing possession, pervaded all her days.&nbsp; God was continually
with her, and she seemed continually yielded up to God.&nbsp; &lsquo;Madame,&rsquo;
said the solitary, &lsquo;you seek without for what you have within.&rsquo;&nbsp;
Where do you seek for God when you pray, my brethren?&nbsp; To what
place do you direct your eyes?&nbsp; Is it to the roof of your closet?&nbsp;
Is it to the east end of your consecrated chapel?&nbsp; Is it to that
wooden table in the east end of your chapel?&nbsp; Or, passing out of
all houses made with hands and consecrated with holy oil, do you lift
up your eyes to the skies where the sun and the moon and the stars dwell
alone?&nbsp; &lsquo;What a folly!&rsquo; exclaims Theophilus, in the
golden dialogue, &lsquo;for no way is the true way to God but by the
way of our own heart.&nbsp; God is nowhere else to be found.&nbsp; And
the heart itself cannot find Him but by its own love of Him, faith in
Him, dependence upon Him, resignation to Him, and expectation of all
from Him.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;You have quite carried your point with
me,&rsquo; answered Theogenes after he had heard all that Theophilus
had to say.&nbsp; &lsquo;The God of meekness, of patience, and of love
is henceforth the one God of my heart.&nbsp; It is now the one bent
and desire of my soul to seek for all my salvation in and through the
merits and mediation of the meek, humble, patient, resigned, suffering
Lamb of God, who alone has power to bring forth the blessed birth of
those heavenly virtues in my soul.&nbsp; What a comfort it is to think
that this Lamb of God, Son of the Father, Light of the World; this Glory
of heaven and this Joy of angels is as near to us, is as truly in the
midst of us, as He is in the midst of heaven.&nbsp; And that not a thought,
look, or desire of our heart that presses toward Him, longing to catch
one small spark of His heavenly nature, but is as sure a way of finding
Him, as the woman&rsquo;s way was who was healed of her deadly disease
by longing to touch but the border of His garment.&rsquo;</p>
<p>To sum up.&nbsp; &lsquo;There is reared up in the midst of Mansoul
a most famous and stately palace: for strength, it may be called a castle;
for pleasantness, a paradise; and for largeness, a place so copious
as to contain all the world.&nbsp; This palace the King intends but
for Himself alone, and not another with Him, and He commits the keeping
of that palace day and night to the men of the town.&rsquo;</p>
<h2>CHAPTER VI&mdash;MY LORD WILLBEWILL</h2>
<blockquote><p>&mdash;&lsquo;to will is present with me.&rsquo;&mdash;<i>Paul</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p>There is a large and a learned literature on the subject of the will.&nbsp;
There is a philosophical and a theological, and there is a religious
and an experimental literature on the will.&nbsp; Jonathan Edwards&rsquo;s
well-known work stands out conspicuously at the head of the philosophical
and theological literature on the will, while our own Thomas Boston&rsquo;s
<i>Fourfold State</i> is a very able and impressive treatise on the
more practical and experimental side of the same subject.&nbsp; The
Westminster Confession of Faith devotes one of its very best chapters
to the teaching of the word of God on the will of man, and the Shorter
Catechism touches on the same subject in Effectual Calling.&nbsp; Outstanding
philosophical and theological schools have been formed around the will,
and both able and learned and earnest men have taken opposite sides
on the subject of the will under the party names of Necessitarians and
Libertarians.&nbsp; This is not the time, nor am I the man, to discuss
such abstruse subjects; but those students who wish to master this great
matter of the will, so far as it can be mastered in books, are recommended
to begin with Dr. William Cunningham&rsquo;s works, and then to go on
from them to a treatise that will reward all their talent and all their
enterprise, Jonathan Edwards&rsquo;s perfect masterpiece.</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; But, to come to my Lord Willbewill, one of the gentry of
the famous town of Mansoul:&mdash;well, this Lord Willbewill was as
high-born as any man in Mansoul, and was as much a freeholder as any
of them were, if not more.&nbsp; Besides, if I remember my tale aright,
he had some privileges peculiar to himself in that famous town.&nbsp;
Now, together with these, he was a man of great strength, resolution,
and courage; nor in his occasion could any turn him away.&nbsp; But
whether he was too proud of his high estate, privileges, and strength,
or what (but sure it was through pride of something), he scorns now
to be a slave in Mansoul, as his own proud word is, so that now, next
to Diabolus himself, who but my Lord Willbewill in all that town?&nbsp;
Nor could anything now be done but at his beck and good pleasure throughout
that town.&nbsp; Indeed, it will not out of my thoughts what a desperate
fellow this Willbewill was when full power was put into his hand.&nbsp;
All which&mdash;how this apostate prince lost power and got it again,
and lost it and got it again&mdash;the interested and curious reader
will find set forth with great fulness and clearness in many powerful
pages of the <i>Holy War</i>.</p>
<p>John Bunyan was as hard put to it to get the right name for this
head of the gentry of Mansoul as Paul was to get the right name for
sin in the seventh of the Romans.&nbsp; In that profoundest and intensest
of all his profound and intense passages, the apostle has occasion to
seek about for some expression, some epithet, some adjective, as we
say, to apply to sin so as to help him to bring out to his Roman readers
something of the malignity, deadliness, and unspeakable evil of sin
as he had sin living and working in himself.&nbsp; But all the resources
of the Greek language, that most resourceful of languages, utterly failed
Paul for his pressing purpose.&nbsp; And thus it is that, as if in scorn
of the feebleness and futility of that boasted tongue, he tramples its
grammars and its dictionaries under his feet, and makes new and unheard-of
words and combinations of words on the spot for himself and for his
subject.&nbsp; He heaps up a hyperbole the like of which no orator or
rhetorician of Greece or Rome had ever needed or had ever imagined before.&nbsp;
He takes sin, and he makes a name for sin out of itself.&nbsp; The only
way to describe sin, he feels, the only way to characterise sin, the
only way to aggravate sin, is just to call it sin; sinful sin; &lsquo;sin
by the commandment became exceeding sinful.&rsquo;&nbsp; And, in like
manner, John Bunyan, who has only his own mother tongue to work with,
in his straits to get a proper name for this terrible fellow who was
next to Diabolus himself, cannot find a proud enough name for him but
just by giving him his own name, and then doubling it.&nbsp; Add will
to will, multiply will by will, and multiply it again, and after you
have done all you are no nearer to a proper name for that apostate,
who, for pride, and insolence, and headstrongness, in one word, for
wilfulness, is next to Diabolus himself.&nbsp; But as Willbewill, if
he is to be named and described at all, is best named and described
by his own naked name; so Bunyan is always best illustrated out of his
own works.&nbsp; And I turn accordingly to the <i>Heavenly Footman</i>
for an excellent illustration of the wilfulness of the will both in
a good man and in a bad; as, thus: &lsquo;Your self-willed people, nobody
knows what to do with them.&nbsp; We use to say, He will have his own
will, do all we can.&nbsp; If a man be willing, then any argument shall
be matter of encouragement; but if unwilling, then any argument shall
give discouragement.&nbsp; The saints of old, they being willing and
resolved for heaven, what could stop them?&nbsp; Could fire and fagot,
sword or halter, dungeons, whips, bears, bulls, lions, cruel rackings,
stonings, starvings, nakedness?&nbsp; So willing had they been made
in the day of His power.&nbsp; And see, on the other side, the children
of the devil, because they are not willing, how many shifts and starting-holes
they will have!&nbsp; I have married a wife; I have a farm; I shall
offend my landlord; I shall lose my trade; I shall be mocked and scoffed
at, and therefore I cannot come.&nbsp; But, alas! the thing is, they
are not willing.&nbsp; For, were they once soundly willing, these, and
a thousand things such as these, would hold them no faster than the
cords held Samson when he broke them like flax.&nbsp; I tell you the
will is all.&nbsp; The Lord give thee a will, then, and courage of heart.&rsquo;</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; Let that, then, suffice for this man&rsquo;s name and nature,
and let us look at him now when his name and his nature have both become
evil; that is to say, when Willbewill has become Illwill.&nbsp; You
can imagine; no, you cannot imagine unless you already know, how evil,
and how set upon evil, Illwill was.&nbsp; His whole mind, we are told,
now stood bending itself to evil.&nbsp; Nay, so set was he now upon
sheer evil that he would act it of his own accord, and without any instigation
at all from Diabolus.&nbsp; And that went on till he was looked on in
the city as next in wickedness to very Diabolus himself.&nbsp; Parable
apart, my ill-willed brethren, our ill-will has made us very fiends
in human shape.&nbsp; What a fall, what a fate, what a curse it is to
be possessed of a devil of ill-will!&nbsp; Who can put proper words
on it after Paul had to confess himself silent before it?&nbsp; Who
can utter the diabolical nature, the depth and the secrecy, the subtlety
and the spirituality, the range and the reach-out of an ill-will?&nbsp;
Our hearts are full of ill-will at those we meet and shake hands with
every day.&nbsp; At men also we have never seen, and who are totally
ignorant even of our existence.&nbsp; Over a thousand miles we dart
our viperous hearts at innocent men.&nbsp; At great statesmen we have
ill-will, and at small; at great churchmen and at small; at great authors
and at small; at great, and famous, and successful men in all lines
of life; for it is enough for ill-will that another man be praised,
and well-paid, and prosperous, and then placed in our eye.&nbsp; No
amount of suffering will satiate ill-will; the very grave has no seal
against it.&nbsp; And, now and then, you have it thrust upon you that
other men have the same devil in them as deeply and as actively as he
is in you.&nbsp; You will suddenly run across a man on the street.&nbsp;
His face was shining with some praise he had just had spoken to him,
or with some recognition he had just received from some great one; or
with some good news for himself he had just heard, before he caught
sight of you.&nbsp; But the light suddenly dies on his face, and darkness
comes up out of his heart at his sudden glimpse of you.&nbsp; What is
the matter? you ask yourself as he scowls past you.&nbsp; What have
you done so to darken any man&rsquo;s heart to you?&nbsp; And as you
stumble on in the sickening cloud he has left behind him, you suddenly
recollect that you were once compelled to vote against that man on a
public question: on some question of home franchise, or foreign war,
or church government, or city business; or perchance, a family has left
his shop to do business in yours, or his church to worship God in yours,
or such like.&nbsp; It will be a certain relief to you to recollect
such things.&nbsp; But with it all there will be a shame and a humiliation
and a deep inward pain that will escape into a cry of prayer for him
and for yourself and for all such sinners on the same street.&nbsp;
If you do not find an escape from your sharp resentment in ejaculatory
prayer and in a heart-cleansing great good-will, your heart, before
you are a hundred steps on, will be as black with ill-will as his is.&nbsp;
But that must not again be.&nbsp; Would you hate or strike back at a
blind man who stumbled and fell against you on the street?&nbsp; Would
you retaliate at a maniac who gnashed his teeth and shook his fist at
you on his way past you to the madhouse?&nbsp; Or at a corpse being
carried past you that had been too long without burial?&nbsp; And shall
you retaliate on a miserable man driven mad with diabolical passion?&nbsp;
Or at a poor sinner whose heart is as rotten as the grave?&nbsp; Ill-will
is abroad in our learned and religious city at all hours of the day
and night.&nbsp; He glares at us under the sun by day, and under the
street lamps at night.&nbsp; We suddenly feel his baleful eye on us
as we thoughtlessly pass under his overlooking windows: it will be a
side street and an unfrequented, where you will not be ashamed and shocked
and pained at heart to meet him.&nbsp; Public men; much purchased and
much praised men; rich and prosperous men; men high in talent and in
place; and, indeed, all manner of men,&mdash;walk abroad in this life
softly.&nbsp; Keep out of sight.&nbsp; Take the side streets, and return
home quickly.&nbsp; You have no idea what an offence and what a snare
you are to men you know, and to men you do not know.&nbsp; If you are
a public man, and if your name is much in men&rsquo;s mouths, then the
place you hold, the prices and the praises you get, do not give you
one-tenth of the pleasure that they give a thousand other men pain.&nbsp;
Men you never heard of, and who would not know you if they met you,
gnaw their hearts at the mere mention of your name.&nbsp; Desire, then,
to be unknown, as &Agrave; Kempis says.&nbsp; O teach me to love to
be concealed, prays Jeremy Taylor.&nbsp; Be ambitious to be unknown,
Archbishop Leighton also instructs us.&nbsp; And the great F&eacute;nelon
took <i>Ama nesciri</i> for his crest and for his motto.&nbsp; No wonder
that an apostle cried out under the agony and the shame of ill-will.&nbsp;
No wonder that to kill it in the hearts of men the Son of God died under
it on the cross.&nbsp; And no wonder that all the gates of hell are
wide open, day and night, for there is no day there, to receive home
all those who will entertain ill-will in their hearts, and all the gates
of heaven shut close to keep all ill-will for ever out.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; But, bad enough as all that is, the half has not been told,
and never will be told in this life.&nbsp; Butler has a passage that
has long stumbled me, and it stumbles me the more the longer I live
and study him and observe myself.&nbsp; &lsquo;Resentment,&rsquo; he
says, in a very deep and a very serious passage&mdash;&lsquo;Resentment
being out of the case, there is not, properly speaking, any such thing
as direct ill-will in one man towards another.&rsquo;&nbsp; Well, great
and undisputed as Butler&rsquo;s authority is in all these matters,
at the same time he would be the first to admit and to assert that a
man&rsquo;s inward experience transcends all outward authority.&nbsp;
Well, I am filled with shame and pain and repentance and remorse to
have to say it, but my experience carries me right in the teeth of Butler&rsquo;s
doctrine.&nbsp; I have dutifully tried to look at Butler&rsquo;s inviting
and exonerating doctrine in all possible lights, and from all possible
points of view, in the anxious wish to prove it true; but I dare not
say that I have succeeded.&nbsp; The truth for thee&mdash;my heart would
continually call to me&mdash;the best truth for thee is in me, and not
in any Butler!&nbsp; And when looking as closely as I can at my own
heart in the matter of ill-will, what do I find&mdash;and what will
you find?&nbsp; You will find that after subtracting all that can in
any proper sense come under the head of real resentment, and in cases
where real resentment is out of the question; in cases where you have
received no injury, no neglect, no contempt, no anything whatsoever
of that kind, you will find that there are men innocent of all that
to you, yet men to whom you entertain feelings, animosities, antipathies,
that can be called by no other name than that of ill-will.&nbsp; Look
within and see.&nbsp; Watch within and see.&nbsp; And I am sure you
will come to subscribe with me to the humbling and heart-breaking truth,
that, even where there is no resentment, and no other explanation, excuse,
or palliation of that kind, yet that festering, secret, malignant ill-will
is working in the bottom of your heart.&nbsp; If you doubt that, if
you deny that, if all that kind of self-observation and self-sentencing
is new to you, then observe yourself, say, for one week, and report
at the end of it whether or no you have had feelings and thoughts and
wishes in your secret heart toward men who never in any way hurt you,
which can only be truthfully described as pure ill-will; that is to
say, you have not felt and thought and wished toward them as you would
have them, and all men, feel and think and wish toward you.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; &lsquo;To will is present with me, but how to perform I
find not,&rsquo; says the apostle; and again, &lsquo;Ye cannot do the
things that ye would.&rsquo;&nbsp; Or, as Dante has it,</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;The power which wills<br />
Bears not supreme control; laughter and tears<br />
Follow so closely on the passion prompts them,<br />
They wait not for the motion of the will<br />
In natures most sincere.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now, just here lies a deep distinction that has not been enough taken
account of by our popular, or even by our more profound, spiritual writers.&nbsp;
The will is often regenerate and right; the will often bends, as Bunyan
has it, to that which is good; but behind the will and beneath the will
the heart is still full of passions, affections, inclinations, dispositions
that are evil; instinctively, impulsively, involuntarily evil, even
&lsquo;in natures most sincere.&rsquo;&nbsp; And hence arises a conflict,
a combat, a death-grip, an agony, a hell on earth, that every regenerate
and advancing soul of man is full of His will is right.&nbsp; If his
will is wrong; if he chooses evil; then there is no mystery in the matter
so far as he is concerned.&nbsp; He is a bad man, and he is so intentionally
and deliberately and of set purpose; and it is a rule in divine truth
that &lsquo;wilfulness in sinning is the measure of our sinfulness.&rsquo;&nbsp;
But his will is right.&nbsp; To will is present with him.&nbsp; He is
every day like Thomas Boston one Sabbath-day: &lsquo;Though I cannot
be free of sin, God Himself knows that He would be welcome to make havoc
of my sins and to make me holy.&nbsp; I know no lust that I would not
be content to part with to-night.&nbsp; My will, bound hand and foot,
I desire to lay at His feet.&rsquo;&nbsp; Now, is it not as clear as
noonday that in the case of such a man as Boston his mind is one thing
and his heart another?&nbsp; Is it not plain that he has both a good-will
and an ill-will within him?&nbsp; A will that immediately and resolutely
chooses for God, and for truth, and for righteousness, and for love;
and another law in his members warring against that law of his mind?&nbsp;
&lsquo;Before conversion,&rsquo; says Thomas Shepard, &lsquo;the main
wound of a man is in his will.&nbsp; And then, after conversion, though
his will is changed, yet, <i>ex infirmitate</i>, there are many things
that he cannot do, so strong is the remnant of malignity that is still
in his heart.&nbsp; Let him get Christ to help him here.&rsquo;&nbsp;
In all that ye see your calling, my brethren.</p>
<p>5.&nbsp; &lsquo;Now, if I do that I would not,&rsquo; adds the apostle,
extricating himself and giving himself fair-play and his simple due
among all his misery and self-accusation&mdash;&lsquo;Now, if I do that
I would not, it is no more I that do it, but sin that dwelleth in me.&rsquo;&nbsp;
Or, again, as William Law has it: &lsquo;All our natural evil ceases
to be our own evil as soon as our will turns away from it.&nbsp; Our
natural evil then changes its nature and loses all its poison and death,
and becomes an holy cross on which we die to self and this life and
enter the kingdom of heaven.&rsquo;&nbsp; My dear brethren, tell me,
is your sin your cross?&nbsp; Is your sinfulness your cross?&nbsp; Is
the evil that is ever present with you your holy cross?&nbsp; For, every
other cross beside sin is a cross of straw, a cross of feathers, a paste-board
and a painted cross, and not a real and genuine cross at all.&nbsp;
The wood and the nails and the spear all taken together were not our
Lord&rsquo;s real cross.&nbsp; His real cross was sin; our sin laid
on His hands, and on His heart, and on His imagination, and on His conscience,
till it was all but His very own sin.&nbsp; Our sin was so fearfully
and wonderfully laid upon Christ that He was as good as a sinner Himself
under it.&nbsp; So much so that all the nails and all the spears, all
the thirst and all the darkness that His body and His soul could hold
were as nothing beside the sin that was laid upon Him.&nbsp; And so
it is with us; with as many of us as are His true disciples.&nbsp; Our
sin is our cross; not our actual transgressions, any more than His;
but our inward sinfulness.&nbsp; And not the sinfulness of our will;
that is no real cross to any man; but the sinfulness of our hearts against
our will, and beneath our will, and behind our will.&nbsp; And this
is such a cross that if Christ had something in His cross that we have
not, then we have something in ours that He had not.&nbsp; He made many
sad and sore Psalms His own; but even if He had lived on earth to read
the seventh of the Romans, He could not have made it His own.&nbsp;
His true people are beyond Him here.&nbsp; The disciple is above his
Master here.&nbsp; The Master had His own cross, and it was a sufficient
cross; but we can challenge Him to come down and look and say if He
ever saw a cross like our cross.&nbsp; He was made a curse.&nbsp; He
was hanged on the tree.&nbsp; He bore our sins in His own body on the
tree.&nbsp; But his people are beyond Him in the real agony and crucifixion
of sin.&nbsp; For He never in Gethsemane or on Calvary either cried
as Paul once cried, and as you and I cry every day&mdash;To will is
present with me!&nbsp; But the good that I would I do not!&nbsp; And,
oh! the body of this death!</p>
<p>6.&nbsp; Now, if any total stranger to all that shall ask me: What
good there is in all that? and, Why I so labour in such a world of unaccustomed
and unpleasant things as that?&nbsp; I have many answers to his censure.&nbsp;
For example, and first, I labour and will continue to labour more and
more in this world of things, and less and less in any other world,
because here we begin to see things as they are&mdash;the deepest things
of God and of man, that is.&nbsp; Also, because I have the precept,
and the example, and the experience of God&rsquo;s greatest and best
saints before me here.&nbsp; Because, also, our full and true salvation
begins here, goes on here, and ends here.&nbsp; Because, also, teaching
these things and learning these things will infallibly make us the humblest
of men, the most contrite, the most self-despising, the most prayerful,
and the most patient, meek, and loving of men.&nbsp; And, students,
I labour in this because this is science; because this is the first
in order and the most fruitful of all the sciences, if not the noblest
and the most glorious of all the sciences.&nbsp; There is all that good
for us in this subject of the will and the heart, and whole worlds of
good lie away out beyond this subject that eye hath not seen nor ear
heard.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER VII&mdash;SELF-LOVE</h2>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;This know, that men shall be lovers of their own
selves, covetous, boasters, proud, unthankful, without natural affection,
truce-breakers, false accusers, traitors, heady, high-minded: from all
such turn away.&rsquo;&mdash;<i>Paul</i>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&lsquo;Pray, sir, said Academicus, tell me more plainly just what
this self of ours actually is.&nbsp; Self, replied Theophilus, is hell,
it is the devil, it is darkness, pain, and disquiet.&nbsp; It is the
one and only enemy of Christ.&nbsp; It is the great antichrist.&nbsp;
It is the scarlet whore, it is the fiery dragon, it is the old serpent
that is mentioned in the Revelation of St John.&nbsp; You rather terrify
me than instruct me by this description, said Academicus.&nbsp; It is
indeed a very frightful matter, returned Theophilus; for it contains
everything that man has to dread and to hate, to resist and to avoid.&nbsp;
Yet be assured, my friend, that, careless and merry as this world is,
every man that is born into this world has all those enemies to overcome
within himself; and every man, till he is in the way of regeneration,
is more or less governed by those enemies.&nbsp; No hell in any remote
place, no devil that is separate from you, no darkness or pain that
is not within you, no antichrist either at Rome or in England, no furious
beast, no fiery dragon, without you or apart from you, can do you any
real hurt.&nbsp; It is your own hell, your own devil, your own beast,
your own antichrist, your own dragon that lives in your own heart&rsquo;s
blood that alone can hurt you.&nbsp; Die to this self, to this inward
nature, and then all outward enemies are overcome.&nbsp; Live to this
self, and then, when this life is out, all that is within you, and all
that is without you, will be nothing else but a mere seeing and feeling
this hell, serpent, beast, and fiery dragon.&nbsp; But, said Theogenes,
a third party who stood by, I would, if I could, more perfectly understand
the precise nature of self, or what it is that makes it to be so full
of evil and misery.&nbsp; To whom Theophilus turned and replied: Covetousness,
envy, pride, and wrath are the four elements of self.&nbsp; And hence
it is that the whole life of self can be nothing else but a plague and
torment of covetousness, envy, pride, and wrath, all of which is precisely
sinful nature, self, or hell.&nbsp; Whilst man lives, indeed, among
the vanities of time, his covetousness, his envy, his pride, and his
wrath, may be in a tolerable state, and may help him to a mixture of
peace and trouble; they may have their gratifications as well as their
torments.&nbsp; But when death has put an end to the vanity of all earthly
cheats, the soul that is not born again of the supernatural Word and
Spirit of God must find itself unavoidably devoured by itself, shut
up in its own insatiable, unchangeable, self-tormenting covetousness,
envy, pride, and wrath.&nbsp; O Theogenes! that I had power from God
to take those dreadful scales off men&rsquo;s eyes that hinder them
from seeing and feeling the infinite importance of this most certain
truth!&nbsp; God give a blessing, Theophilus, to your good prayer.&nbsp;
And then let me tell you that you have quite satisfied my question about
the nature of self.&nbsp; I shall never forget it, nor can I ever possibly
after this have any doubt about the truth of it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; &lsquo;All my theology,&rsquo; said an old friend of mine
to me not long ago&mdash;&lsquo;all my theology is out of Thomas Goodwin
to the Ephesians.&rsquo;&nbsp; Well, I find Thomas Goodwin saying in
that great book that self is the very quintessence of original sin;
and, again, he says, study self-love for a thousand years and it is
the top and the bottom of original sin; self is the sin that dwelleth
in us and that doth most easily beset us.&nbsp; Now, that is just what
Academicus and Theophilus and Theogenes have been saying to us in their
own powerful way in their incomparable dialogue.&nbsp; All sin and all
misery; all covetousness, envy, pride, and wrath,&mdash;trace it all
back to its roots, travel it all up to its source, and, as sure as you
do that, self and self-love are that source, that root, and that black
bottom.&nbsp; I do not forget that Butler has said in some stately pages
of his that self-love is morally good; that self-love is coincident
with the principle of virtue and part of the idea; and that it is a
proper motive for man.&nbsp; But the deep bishop, in saying all that,
is away back at the creation-scheme and Eden-state of human nature.&nbsp;
He has not as yet come down to human nature in its present state of
overthrow, dismemberment, and self-destruction.&nbsp; But when he does
condescend and comes close to the mind and the heart of man as they
now are in all men, even Butler becomes as outspoken, and as eloquent,
and as full of passion and pathos as if he were an evangelical Puritan.&nbsp;
Self-love, Butler startles his sober-minded reader as he bursts out&mdash;self-love
rends and distorts the mind of man!&nbsp; Now, you are a man.&nbsp;
Well, then, do you feel and confess that rending and distorting to have
taken place in you?&nbsp; Butler is a philosopher, and Goodwin is a
preacher, but you are more: you are a man.&nbsp; You are the owner of
a human heart, and you can say whether or no it is a rent and a distorted
heart.&nbsp; Is your mind warped and wrenched by self-love, and is your
heart rent and torn by the same wicked hands?&nbsp; Do you really feel
that it needs nothing more to take you back again to paradise but that
your heart be delivered from self-love?&nbsp; Do you now understand
that the foundations of heaven itself must be laid in a heart healed
and cleansed and delivered from self-love?&nbsp; If you do, then your
knowledge of your own heart has set you abreast of the greatest of philosophers
and theologians and preachers.&nbsp; Nay, before multitudes of men who
are called such.&nbsp; It is my meditation all the day, you say.&nbsp;
I have more understanding now than all my teachers; for Thy testimonies
are my meditation.&nbsp; I understand more than the ancients; because
now I keep Thy precepts.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; &lsquo;Self-love has made us all malicious,&rsquo; says
John Calvin.&nbsp; We are Calvinists, were we to call any man master.&nbsp;
But we are to call no man master, and least of all in the matters of
the heart.&nbsp; Every man must be his own philosopher, his own moralist,
and his own theologian in the matters of the heart.&nbsp; He who has
a heart in his bosom and an eye in his head can need no Calvin, no Butler,
no Goodwin, and no Law to tell him what goes on in his own heart.&nbsp;
And, on the other hand, his own heart will soon tell him whether or
no Calvin, and Butler, and Goodwin, and Law know anything about those
matters on which some men would set them up as our masters.&nbsp; Well,
come away all of you who own a human heart.&nbsp; Come and say whether
or no your heart, and the self-love of which it is full, have made you
a malicious man.&nbsp; I do not ask if you are always and to everybody
full of maliciousness.&nbsp; No; I know quite well that you are sometimes
as sweet as honey and as soft as butter.&nbsp; For, has not even Theophilus
said that whilst a man still lives among the vanities of time, his covetousness,
his envy, his pride, and his wrath may be in a tolerable state, and
may help him to a mixture of peace and trouble; these vices may have
their gratifications as well as their torments.&nbsp; No; I do not trifle
with you and with this serious matter so as to ask if you are full of
malice at all times and to all men.&nbsp; No.&nbsp; For, let a man be
fortunate enough to be on your side; let him pass over to your party;
let him become profitable to you; let him be clever enough and mean
enough to praise and to flatter you up to the top of your appetite for
praise and flattery, and, no doubt, you will love that man.&nbsp; Or,
if that is not exactly love, at least it is no longer hate.&nbsp; But
let that man unfortunately be led to leave your party; let him cease
being profitable to you; let him weary of flattering you with his praise;
let him forget you, neglect you, despise you, and go against you, and
then look at your own heart.&nbsp; Do you care now to know what malice
is?&nbsp; Well, that is malice that distorts and rends your heart as
often as you meet that man on the street or even pass by his door.&nbsp;
That is malice that dances in your eyes when you see his name in print.&nbsp;
That is malice with which you always break out when his name is mentioned
in conversation.&nbsp; That is malice that heats your heart when you
suddenly recollect him in the multitude of your thoughts within you.&nbsp;
And you are in good company all the time.&nbsp; &lsquo;We, ourselves,&rsquo;
says Paul to Titus, &lsquo;we also at one time lived in malice and in
envy.&nbsp; We were hateful and we hated one another.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Hateful,&rsquo;
Goodwin goes on in his great book, &lsquo;every man is to another man
more or less; he is hated of another and he hateth another more or less;
and if his nature were let out to the full, there is that in him, &ldquo;every
man is against every man,&rdquo; as is said of Ishmael.&nbsp; <i>Homo
homini lupus</i>,&rsquo; adds our brave preacher.&nbsp; And Abb&eacute;
Grou speaks out with the same challenge from the opposite church pole,
and says: &lsquo;Yes; self-love makes us touchy, ready to take offence,
ill-tempered, suspicious, severe, exacting, easily offended; it keeps
alive in our hearts a certain malignity, a secret joy at the mortifications
which befall our neighbour; it nourishes our readiness to criticise,
our dislike at certain persons, our ill-feeling, our bitterness, and
a thousand other things prejudicial to charity.&rsquo;</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; &lsquo;Myself is my own worst enemy,&rsquo; says Abb&eacute;
Grou.&nbsp; That is to say, we may have enemies who hate us more than
we hate ourselves, and enemies who would hurt us, if they could, as
much as we hurt ourselves; but the Abb&eacute;&rsquo;s point is that
they cannot.&nbsp; And he is right.&nbsp; No man has ever hurt me as
I have hurt myself.&nbsp; There are men who hate me so much that they
would poison my life of all its peace and happiness if they could.&nbsp;
But they cannot.&nbsp; They cannot; but let them not be cast down on
that account, for there is one who can do, and who will do as long as
he lives, what they cannot do.&nbsp; A man&rsquo;s foes, to be called
foes, are in his own house: they are in his own heart.&nbsp; Let our
enemies attend to their own peace and happiness, and our self-love will
do all, and more than all, that they would fain do.&nbsp; At the most,
they and their ill-will can only give occasion to our self-love; but
it is our self-love that seizes upon the occasion, and through it rends
and distorts our own hearts.&nbsp; And were our hearts only pure of
self-love, were our hearts only clothed with meekness and humility,
we could laugh at all the ill-will of our enemies as leviathan laughs
at the shaking of a spear.&nbsp; &lsquo;Know thou,&rsquo; says &Agrave;
Kempis to his son, &lsquo;that the love of thyself doth do thee more
hurt than anything in the whole world.&rsquo;&nbsp; Yes; but we shall
never know that by merely reading <i>The Imitation</i>.&nbsp; We must
read ourselves.&nbsp; We must study, as we study nothing else, our own
rent and distorted hearts.&nbsp; Our own hearts must be our daily discovery.&nbsp;
We must watch the wounds our hearts take every day; and we must give
all our powers of mind to tracing all our wounds back to their true
causes.&nbsp; We must say: &lsquo;that sore blow came on my mind and
on my heart from such and such a quarter, from such and such a hand,
from such and such a weapon; but this pain, this rankling, poisoned,
and ever-festering wound, this sleepless, gnawing, cancerous sore, comes
from the covetousness, the pride, the envy, and the wrath of my own
heart.&rsquo;&nbsp; When we begin to say that, we shall then begin to
understand and to love Thomas; we shall sit daily at his feet and shall
be numbered among his sons.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; And this suffering at our own hands goes on till at last
the tables are completely turned against self-love, and till what was
once to us the dearest thing in the whole world becomes, as Pascal says,
the most hateful.&nbsp; We begin life by hating the men, and the things,
who hurt us.&nbsp; We hate the men who oppose us and hinder us; the
men who speak, and write, and act, and go in any way against us.&nbsp;
We bitterly hate all who humble us, despise us, trample upon us, and
in any way ill-use us.&nbsp; But afterwards, when we have become men,
men in experience of this life, and, especially, of ourselves in this
life; after we gain some real insight and attain to some real skill
in the life of the heart, we come round to forgive those we once hated.&nbsp;
We have come now to see why they did it.&nbsp; We see now exactly how
much they hurt us after all, and how little.&nbsp; And, especially,
we have come to see,&mdash;what at one time we could not have believed,&mdash;that
all our hurt, to be called hurt, has come to us from ourselves.&nbsp;
And thus that great revolution of mind and that great revulsion of feeling
and of passion has taken place, after which we are left with no one
henceforth to hate, to be called hating, but ourselves.&nbsp; We may
still continue to avoid our enemies, and we may do that too long and
too much; we may continue to fear them and be on the watch against them
far too much; but to deliberately hate them is henceforth impossible.&nbsp;
All our hatred,&mdash;all our deliberate, steady, rooted, active hatred,&mdash;is
now at ourselves; at ourselves, that is, so far and so long as we remain
under the malignant and hateful dominion of self-love.&nbsp; When Butler
gets our self-love restored to reasonableness, and made coincident with
virtue and part of the idea; when our self-love becomes uniformly coincident
with the principle of obedience to God&rsquo;s commands, then we shall
love ourselves as our neighbour, and our neighbour as ourselves, and
both in God.&nbsp; But, till then, there is nothing and no one on earth
or in hell so hateful to us as ourselves and our own hateful hearts.&nbsp;
And if in that we are treading the winepress alone as far as our fellow-men
are concerned, all the more we have Him with us in all our agony who
wept over the heart of man because He knew what was in it, and what
must always come out of it.&nbsp; Evil thoughts, He said, and fornications,
and murders, and thefts, and covetousness, and wickedness, and deceit,
and an evil eye, and pride, and folly, and what not.&nbsp; And Paul
has the mind of Christ with him in the text.&nbsp; I do not need to
repeat again the hateful words.&nbsp; Now, what do you say? was Pascal
beyond the truth, was he deeper than the truth or more deadly than the
truth when he said with a stab that self is hateful?&nbsp; I think not.</p>
<p>5.&nbsp; &lsquo;Oh that I were free, then, of myself,&rsquo; wrote
Samuel Rutherford from Aberdeen in 1637 to John Ferguson of Ochiltree.&nbsp;
&lsquo;What need we all have to be ransomed and redeemed from that master-tyrant,
that cruel and lawless lord, ourself!&nbsp; Even when I am most out
of myself, and am best serving Christ, I have a squint eye on myself.&rsquo;&nbsp;
And to the Laird of Cally in the same year and from the same place:
&lsquo;Myself is the master idol we all bow down to.&nbsp; Every man
blameth the devil for his sins, but the house devil of every man that
eateth with him and lieth in his bosom is himself.&nbsp; Oh blessed
are they who can deny themselves!&rsquo;&nbsp; And to the Irish ministers
the year after: &lsquo;Except men martyr and slay the body of sin in
sanctified self-denial, they shall never be Christ&rsquo;s.&nbsp; Oh,
if I could but be master of myself, my own mind, my own will, my own
credit, my own love, how blessed were I!&nbsp; But alas!&nbsp; I shall
die only minting and aiming at being a Christian.&rsquo;</p>
<h2>CHAPTER VIII&mdash;OLD MR. PREJUDICE, THE KEEPER OF EAR-GATE, WITH
HIS SIXTY DEAF MEN UNDER HIM</h2>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Are not Abana and Pharpar, rivers of Damascus,
better than all the waters of Israel?&rsquo;&mdash;<i>Naaman</i>.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Can there any good thing come out of Nazareth?&rsquo;&mdash;<i>Nathanael</i>.</p>
<p>&lsquo; . . observe these things without prejudice, doing nothing
by partiality.&rsquo;&mdash;<i>Paul</i>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Old Mr. Prejudice was well known in the wars of Mansoul as an angry,
unhappy, and ill-conditioned old churl.&nbsp; Old Mr. Prejudice was
placed by Diabolus, his master, as keeper of the ward at the post of
Ear-gate, and for that fatal service he had sixty completely deaf men
put under him as his company.&nbsp; Men eminently advantageous for that
fatal service.&nbsp; Eminently advantageous,&mdash;inasmuch as it mattered
not one atom to them what was spoken in their ear either by God or by
man.</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; Now, to begin with, this churlish old man had already earned
for himself a very evil name.&nbsp; For what name could well be more
full of evil memories and of evil omens than just this name of Prejudice?&nbsp;
Just consider what prejudice is.&nbsp; Prejudice, when we stop over
it and take it to pieces and look well at it,&mdash;prejudice is so
bad and so abominable that you would not believe it could be so bad
till you had looked at it and at how it acts in your own case.&nbsp;
For prejudice gives judgment on your case and gives orders for your
execution before your defence has been heard, before your witnesses
have been called, before your summons has been served, ay, and even
before your indictment has been drawn out.&nbsp; What a scandal and
what an uproar a malfeasance of justice like that would cause if it
were to take place in any of our courts of law!&nbsp; Only, the thing
is impossible; you cannot even imagine it.&nbsp; We shall have Magna
Charta up before us in the course of these lectures.&nbsp; Well, ever
since Magna Charta was extorted from King John, such a scandal as I
have supposed has been impossible either in England or in Scotland.&nbsp;
And that such cases should still be possible in Russia and in Turkey
places those two old despotisms outside the pale of the civilised world.&nbsp;
And yet, loudly as we all denounce the Czar and the Sultan, eloquently
as we boast over Magna Charta, Habeas Corpus, and what not, every day
you and I are doing what would cost an English king his crown, and an
English judge his head.&nbsp; We all do it every day, and it never enters
one mind out of a hundred that we are trampling down truth, and righteousness,
and fair-play, and brotherly love.&nbsp; We do not know what a diabolical
wickedness we are perpetrating every day.&nbsp; The best men among us
are guilty of that iniquity every day, and they never confess it to
themselves; no one ever accuses them of it; and they go down to death
and judgment unsuspicious of the discovery that they will soon make
there.&nbsp; You would not steal a stick or a straw that belonged to
me; but you steal from me every day what all your gold and mine can
never redeem; you murder me every day in my best and my noblest life.&nbsp;
You me, and I you.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; Old Mr. Prejudice.&nbsp; Now, there is a golden passage
in Jonathan Edwards&rsquo;s <i>Diary</i> that all old men should lay
well to heart and conscience.&nbsp; &lsquo;I observe,&rsquo; Edwards
enters, &lsquo;that old men seldom have any advantage of new discoveries,
because these discoveries are beside a way of thinking they have been
long used to.&nbsp; Resolved, therefore, that, if ever I live to years,
I will be impartial to hear the reasons of all pretended discoveries,
and receive them, if rational, how long soever I have been used to another
way of thinking.&nbsp; I am too dogmatical; I have too much of egotism;
my disposition is always to be telling of my dislike and my scorn.&rsquo;&nbsp;
What a fine, fresh, fruitful, progressive, and peaceful world we should
soon have if all our old and all our fast-ageing men would enter that
extract into their diary!&nbsp; How the young would then love and honour
and lean upon the old; and how all the fathers would always abide young
and full of youthful life like their children!&nbsp; Then the righteous
should flourish like the palm-tree; he should grow like a cedar in Lebanon.&nbsp;
They that be planted in the house of the Lord shall flourish in the
courts of our God.&nbsp; They shall still bring forth fruit in old age;
they shall be fat and flourishing.&nbsp; What a free scope would then
be given to all God&rsquo;s unfolding providences, and what a warm welcome
to all His advancing truths!&nbsp; What sore and spreading wounds would
then be salved, what health and what vigour would fill all the body
political, as well as all the body mystical!&nbsp; May the Lord turn
the heart of the fathers to the children, and the heart of the children
to their fathers, lest the earth be smitten with a curse!</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; Mr. Prejudice was an old man; and this also has been handed
down about him, that he was almost always angry.&nbsp; And if you keep
your eyes open you will soon see how true to the life that feature of
old Mr. Prejudice still is.&nbsp; In every conversation, discussion,
debate, correspondence, the angry man is invariably the prejudiced man;
and, according to the age and the depth, the rootedness and the intensity
of his prejudices, so is the ferocity and the savagery of his anger.&nbsp;
He has already settled this case that you are irritating and wronging
him so much by your still insisting on bringing up.&nbsp; It is a reproach
to his understanding for you to think that there is anything to be said
in that matter that he has not long ago heard said and fully answered.&nbsp;
Has he not denounced that bad man and that bad cause for years?&nbsp;
You insult me, sir, by again opening up that matter in my presence.&nbsp;
He will have none of you or of your arguments either.&nbsp; You are
as bad yourself as that bad man is whose advocate you are.&nbsp; We
all know men whose hearts are full of coals of juniper, burning coals
of hate and rage, just by reason of their ferocious prejudices.&nbsp;
Hate is too feeble a word for their gnashing rage against this man and
that cause, this movement and that institution.&nbsp; There is an absolutely
murderous light in their eye as they work themselves up against the
men and the things they hate.&nbsp; Charity rejoices not in iniquity;
but you will see otherwise Christian and charitable men so jockeyed
by the devil that they actually rejoice in iniquity and do not know
what they are doing, or who it is that is egging them on to do it.&nbsp;
You will see otherwise and at other times good men so full of the rage
and madness of prejudice and partiality that they will storm at every
report of goodness and truth and prosperity in the man, or in the cause,
or in the church, or in the party, they are so demented against.&nbsp;
Jockey is not the word.&nbsp; There is the last triumph of pure devilry
in the way that the prince of the devils turns old Prejudice&rsquo;s
very best things&mdash;his love of his fathers, his love of the past,
his love of order, his love of loyalty, his love of the old paths, and
his very truest and best religion itself&mdash;into so much fat fuel
for the fires of hate and rage that are consuming his proud heart to
red-hot ashes.&nbsp; If the light that is in us be darkness, how great
is that darkness; and if the life that is in us be death, how deadly
is that death!</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; Old, angry, and ill-conditioned.&nbsp; Ill-conditioned is
an old-fashioned word almost gone out of date.&nbsp; But, all the same,
it is a very expressive, and to us to-night a quite indispensable word.&nbsp;
An ill-conditioned man is a man of an in-bred, cherished, and confirmed
ill-nature.&nbsp; His heart, which was a sufficiently bad heart to begin
with, is now so exercised in evil and so accustomed to evil, that,&mdash;how
can he be born again when he is so old and so ill-natured?&nbsp; All
the qualities, all the passions, all the emotions of his heart are out
of joint; their bent is bad; they run out naturally to mischief.&nbsp;
Now, what could possibly be more ill-conditioned than to judge and sentence,
denounce and execute a man before you have heard his case?&nbsp; What
could be more ill-conditioned than positively to be afraid lest you
should be led to forgive, and redress, and love, and act with another
man?&nbsp; To be determined not to hear one word that you can help in
his defence, in his favour, and in his praise?&nbsp; Could a human heart
be in a worse state on this side hell itself than that?&nbsp; Nay, that
is hell itself in your evil heart already.&nbsp; Let prejudice and partiality
have their full scope among the wicked passions of your ill-conditioned
heart, and lo! the kingdom of darkness is already within you.&nbsp;
Not, lo, here! or, lo, there! but within you.&nbsp; Look to yourselves,
says John to us all, full as we all are of our own ill-conditions.&nbsp;
Look to yourselves.&nbsp; But we have no eyes left with which to see
ourselves; we look so much at the faults and the blames of our neighbour.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Publius goes to church sometimes, and reads the Scriptures; but
he knows not what he reads or prays, his head is so full of politics.&nbsp;
He is so angry at kings and ministers of state that he has no time nor
disposition to call himself to account.&nbsp; He has the history of
all parliaments, elections, prosecutions, and impeachments by heart,
and he dies with little or no religion, through a constant fear of Popery.&rsquo;&nbsp;
Poor, old, ill-conditioned Publius!</p>
<p>5.&nbsp; And, then, his sixty deaf men under old, angry, ill-conditioned
Prejudice.&nbsp; We read of engines of sixty-horse power.&nbsp; And
here is a man with the power of resisting and shutting out the truth
equal to that of sixty men like himself.&nbsp; We all know such men;
we would as soon think of speaking to those iron pillars about a change
of mind as we would to them.&nbsp; If you preach to their prejudices
and their prepossessions and their partialities, they are all ears to
hear you, and all tongues to trumpet your praise.&nbsp; But do not expect
them to sit still with ordinary decency under what they are so prejudiced
against; do not expect them to read a book or buy a passing paper on
the other side.&nbsp; Sixty deaf men hold their ears; sixty ill-conditioned
men hold their hearts.&nbsp; Habit with them is all the test of truth;
it must be right, they&rsquo;ve done it from their youth.&nbsp; And
thus they go on to the end of their term of life, full of their own
fixed ideas, with their eyes full of beams and jaundices and darkness
and death.&nbsp; Some people think that we take up too much of our time
with newspapers in our day, and that, if things go on as they are going,
we shall soon have neither time nor taste for anything else but half
a dozen papers a day.&nbsp; But all that depends on the conditions with
which we read.&nbsp; If we would read as Jonathan Edwards read the weekly
news-letters of his day; if we read all our papers to see if the kingdom
of God was coming in reply to our prayer; if we read, observing all
things, like Timothy, without prejudice or partiality, then I know no
better reading for an ill-conditioned heart begun to look to itself
than just a good, out-and-out party newspaper.&nbsp; And if it is a
church paper all the better for your purpose.&nbsp; If you read with
your fingers in your ears; if you read with a beam in your eye, you
had better confine yourself in your reading; if you feel that your prejudices
are inflamed and your partiality is intensified, then take care what
paper you take in.&nbsp; But if you read all you read for the love of
the truth, for justice, for fair-play, and for brotherly love, and all
that in yourself; if you read all the time with your eyes on your own
ill-conditioned heart, then, as James says, count it all joy when you
fall into divers temptations.&nbsp; Take up your political and ecclesiastical
paper every morning, saying to yourself, Go to, O my heart, and get
thy daily lesson.&nbsp; Go to, and enter thy cleansing and refining
furnace.&nbsp; Go to, and come well out of thy daily temptation.&mdash;A
nobler school you will not find anywhere for a prejudiced, partial,
angry, and ill-conditioned heart than just the party journals of the
day.&nbsp; For the abating of prejudice; for seeing the odiousness of
partiality, and for putting on every day a fair, open, catholic, Christian
mind, commend me to the public life and the public journals of our living
day.&nbsp; And it is not that this man may be up and that man down;
this cause victorious and that cause defeated; this truth vindicated
and that untruth defeated, that public life rolls on and that its revolutions
are reported to us.&nbsp; Our own minds and our own hearts are the final
cause, the ultimate drift, and the far-off end and aim of it all.&nbsp;
We are not made for party and for the partialities and prosperities
of party; party and all its passions and all its successes and all its
defeats are made, and are permitted to be made for us; for our opportunity
of purging ourselves free of all our ill-conditions, of all our prejudices,
of all our partialities, and of all the sin and misery that come to
us of all these things.</p>
<p>6.&nbsp; &lsquo;It is the work of a philosopher,&rsquo; says Addison
in one of his best <i>Spectators</i>, &lsquo;to be every day subduing
his passions and laying aside his prejudices.&rsquo;&nbsp; We are not
philosophers, but we shall be enrolled in the foremost ranks of philosophy
if we imitate such philosophers in their daily work, as we must do and
shall do.&nbsp; Well, are we begun to do it?&nbsp; Are we engaged in
that work of theirs and ours every day?&nbsp; Is God our witness and
our judge that we are?&nbsp; Are we so engaged upon that inward work,
and so succeeding in it, that we can read our most prejudiced newspaper
with the same mind and spirit, with the same profit and progress, with
which we read our Bible?&nbsp; A good man, a humble man, a man acutely
sensible of his ill-conditions, will look on every day as lost or won
according as he has lost or won in this inward war.&nbsp; If his partialities
are dropping off his mind; if his prejudices are melting; if he can
read books and papers with pleasure and instruction that once filled
him with dark passions and angry outbursts; if his Calvinism lets him
read Thomas &Agrave; Kempis and Jeremy Taylor and William Law; if his
High-Churchism lets him delight to worship God in an Independent or
a Presbyterian church; if his Free-Churchism permits him to see the
Establishment reviving, and his State-Churchism admits that the Free
Churches have more to say to him than he had at one time thought; if
his Toryism lets him take in a Radical paper, and his Radicalism a Unionist
paper&mdash;then let him thank God, for God is in all that though he
knew it not.&nbsp; And when he counts up his incalculable benefits at
each return of the Lord&rsquo;s table, let him count up as not the least
of them an open mind and a well-conditioned heart, an unprejudiced mind,
and an impartial heart.</p>
<p>7.&nbsp; And now, to conclude: Take old, angry, ill-conditioned Prejudice,
his daily prayer: &lsquo;My Adorable God and Creator!&nbsp; Thy Holy
Church is by the wickedness of men divided into various communions,
all hating, condemning, and endeavouring to destroy one another.&nbsp;
I made none of these divisions, nor am I any longer a defender of them.&nbsp;
I wish everything removed out of every communion that hinders the Common
Unity.&nbsp; The wranglings and disputings of whole churches and nations
have so confounded all things that I have no ability to make a true
and just judgment of the matters between them.&nbsp; If I knew that
any one of these communions was alone acceptable to Thee, I would do
or suffer anything to make myself a member of it.&nbsp; For, my Good
God, I desire nothing so much as to know and to love Thee, and to worship
Thee in the most acceptable manner.&nbsp; And as I humbly presume that
Thou wouldst not suffer Thy Church to be thus universally divided, if
no divided portion could offer any worship acceptable unto Thee; and
as I have no knowledge of what is absolutely best in these divided parts,
nor any ability to put an end to them; so I fully trust in Thy goodness,
that Thou wilt not suffer these divisions to separate me from Thy mercy
in Christ Jesus; and that, if there be any better ways of serving Thee
than those I already enjoy, Thou wilt, according to Thine infinite mercy,
lead me into them, O God of my peace and my love.&rsquo;&nbsp; After
this manner old, angry, ill-conditioned Prejudice prayed every day till
he died, a little child, in charity with all men, and in acceptance
with Almighty God.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER IX&mdash;CAPTAIN ANYTHING</h2>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;I am made all things to all men . . . I please
all men in all things.&rsquo;&mdash;<i>Paul</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Captain Anything came originally from the ancient town of Fair-speech.</p>
<p>Fair-speech had many royal bounties and many special privileges bestowed
upon it, and Captain Anything and his family had come to many titles
and to great riches in that ancient, loyal, and honourable borough.&nbsp;
My Lord Turn-about, my Lord Time-server, my Lord Fair-speech (from whose
ancestors that town first took its name), as also such well-known commoners
as Mr. Smooth-man, Mr. Facing-both-ways, and Mr. Two-tongues were all
sprung with Captain Anything from the same ancient and long-established
ancestry.&nbsp; As to his religion, from a child young Anything had
sat under the parson of the parish, the same Reverend Two-tongues as
has been mentioned above.&nbsp; And our budding soldier followed the
example of his minister in that he never strove too long against wind
or tide, or was ever to be seen on the same side of the street with
Religion when she was banished from court or had lost her silver slippers.&nbsp;
The crest of the Anythings was a delicately poised weather-cock; and
the motto engraved around the gyrating bird ran thus: &lsquo;Our judgment
always jumps according to the occasion.&rsquo;&nbsp; As a military man,
Captain Anything is described in military books as a proper man, and
a man of courage and skill&mdash;to appearance.&nbsp; He and his company
under him were a sort of Swiss guard in Mansoul.&nbsp; They held themselves
open and ready for any master.&nbsp; They lived not so much by religion
or by loyalty as by the fates of worldly fortune.&nbsp; In his secret
despatches Diabolus was wont to address Captain Anything as My Darling;
and be sure you recruit your Switzers well, Diabolus would say; but
when the real stress of the war came, even Diabolus cast Captain Anything
off.&nbsp; And thus it came about that when both sides were against
this despised creature he had to throw down his arms and flee into a
safe skulking place for his life.</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; In that half-papist, half-atheistic country called France
there is a class of politicians known by the name of Opportunists.&nbsp;
They are a kind of public men that, we are thankful to say, are not
known in Protestant and Evangelical England, but they may be pictured
out and described to you in this homely way: An Opportunist stands well
out of the sparks of the fire, and well in behind the stone wall, till
the fanatics for liberty, equality, and fraternity have snatched the
chestnuts out of the fire, and then the Opportunist steps out from his
safe place and blandly divides the well-roasted tid-bits among his family
and his friends.&nbsp; As long as there is any jeopardy, the Jacobins
are denounced and held up to opprobrium; but when the jeopardy and the
risk are well past, the sober-minded, cautious, conservative, and responsible
statesmen walk off with the portfolios of place and privilege and pay
under their honest arms.&nbsp; But these are the unprincipled papists
and infidels of a mushroom republic; and, thank God, such spurious patriotism,
and such sham and selfish statesmanship, have not yet shown their miserable
heads among faithful, fearless, straightforward, and uncalculating Englishmen.&nbsp;
At the same time, if ever that continental vice should attack our national
character, we have two well-known essays in our ethical and casuistical
literature that may with perfect safety be pitted against anything that
either France or Italy has produced.&nbsp; Even if they are but a master&rsquo;s
irony, let all ambitious men keep <i>Of Cunning</i> and <i>Of Wisdom
for a Man&rsquo;s Self</i> under their pillow.&nbsp; Let all young men
who would toady a great man; let all young ministers who would tune
their pulpit to king, or court, or society; let all tradesmen and merchants
who prefer their profits to their principles&mdash;if they have literature
enough, let them soak their honest minds in our great Chancellor&rsquo;s
sage counsels; and he who promoted Anything and dubbed him his Darling,
he will, no doubt, publish both a post and a title on his birthday for
you also.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; &lsquo;What religion is he of?&rsquo; asks Dean Swift.&nbsp;
&lsquo;He is an Anythingarian,&rsquo; is the answer, &lsquo;for he makes
his self-interest the sole standard of his life and doctrine.&rsquo;&nbsp;
And Archbishop Leighton, a very different churchman from the bitter
author of the <i>Polite Conversations</i>, is equally contemptuous toward
the self-seeker in divine things.&nbsp; &lsquo;Your boasted peaceableness
often proceeds from a superficial temper; and, not seldom, from a supercilious
disdain of whatever has no marketable use or value, and from your utter
indifference to true religion.&nbsp; Toleration is an herb of spontaneous
growth in the soil of indifference.&nbsp; Much of our union of minds
proceeds from want of knowledge and from want of affection to religion.&nbsp;
Many who boast of their church conformity, and that no one hears of
their noise, may thank the ignorance of their minds for that kind of
quietness.&rsquo;&nbsp; But by far the most powerful assault that ever
was made upon lukewarmness in religion and upon self-seeking in the
Church was delivered by Dante in the tremendous third canto of his <i>Inferno</i>:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Various tongues,<br />
Horrible languages, outcries of woe,<br />
Accents of anger, voices deep and hoarse,<br />
With hands together smote that swelled the sounds,<br />
Made up a tumult that for ever whirls<br />
Round through that air with solid darkness stain&rsquo;d,<br />
Like to the sand that in the whirlwind flies.<br />
I then, with error yet encompass&rsquo;d, cried,<br />
&lsquo;O master!&nbsp; What is this I hear?&nbsp; What race<br />
Are these, who seem so overcome with woe?&rsquo;<br />
He then to me: &lsquo;This miserable fate<br />
Suffer the wretched souls of those who lived<br />
Without or praise or blame, with that ill band<br />
Of angels mixed, who nor rebellious proved,<br />
Nor yet were true to God, but for themselves<br />
Were only.&nbsp; Mercy and Justice scorn them both.<br />
Speak not of them, but look and pass them by.&rsquo;<br />
Forthwith, I understood for certain this the tribe<br />
Of those ill spirits both to God displeasing<br />
And to His foes.&nbsp; Those wretches who ne&rsquo;er lived,<br />
Went on in nakedness, and sorely stung<br />
By wasps and hornets, which bedewed their cheeks<br />
With blood, that mix&rsquo;d with tears dropp&rsquo;d to their feet,<br />
And by disgustful worms was gathered there.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>3.&nbsp; Now, we must all lay it continually and with uttermost humiliation
to heart that we all have Captain Anything&rsquo;s opportunism, his
self-interest, his insincerity, his instability, and his secret deceitfulness
in ourselves.&nbsp; That man knows little of himself who does not despise
and hate himself for his secret self-seeking even in the service of
God.&nbsp; For, how the love of praise will seduce and corrupt this
man, and the love of gain that man!&nbsp; How easy it is to flatter
and adulate this man out of all his former opinions and his deepest
principles, and how an expected advantage will make that other man forget
now an old alliance and now a deep antipathy!&nbsp; How often the side
we take even in the most momentous matters is decided by the most unworthy
motives and the most contemptible considerations!&nbsp; Unstable as
water, Reuben shall not excel.&nbsp; Double-minded men, we, like Jacob&rsquo;s
first-born, are unstable in all our ways.&nbsp; We have no anchor, or,
what anchor we sometimes have soon slips.&nbsp; We have no fixed pole-star
by which to steer our life.&nbsp; Any will-o&rsquo;-the-wisp of pleasure,
or advantage, or praise will run us on the rocks.&nbsp; The searchers
of Mansoul, after long search, at last lighted on Anything, and soon
made an end of him.&nbsp; Seek him out in your own soul also.&nbsp;
Be you sure he is somewhere there.&nbsp; He is skulking somewhere there.&nbsp;
And, having found him, if you cannot on the spot make an end of him,
keep your eye on him, and never say that you are safe from him and his
company as long as you are in this soul-deceiving life.&nbsp; And, that
Anything will not be let enter the gates of the city you are set on
seeking, that will go largely to make that sweet and clean and truthful
city your very heaven to you.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; &lsquo;I am made all things to all men, and I please all
men in all things.&rsquo;&nbsp; One would almost think that was Captain
Anything himself, in a frank, cynical, and self-censorious moment.&nbsp;
But if you will look it up you will see that it was a very different
man.&nbsp; The words are the words of Anything, but the heart behind
the words is the heart of Paul.&nbsp; And this, again, teaches us that
we should be like the Messiah in this also, not to judge after the sight
of our eyes, nor to reprove after the hearing of our ears.&nbsp; Miserable
Anything! outcast alike of heaven and hell!&nbsp; But, O noble and blessed
Apostle! the man, says Thomas Goodwin, who shall be found seated next
to Jesus Christ Himself in the kingdom of God.&nbsp; Happy Paul: happy
even on this earth, since he could say, and in the measure he could
say with truth and with sincerity, such self-revelations as these: &lsquo;Unto
the Jews I am become as a Jew that I might gain the Jews; to them that
are under the law, as under the law, that I might gain them that are
under the law.&nbsp; To them that are without law, as without law, that
I might gain them that are without law.&nbsp; To the weak became I as
weak, that I might gain the weak; I am made all things to all men, that
I might by all means save some.&nbsp; Giving none offence, neither to
the Jews, nor to the Gentiles, nor to the Church of God.&nbsp; Even
as I please all men in all things, not seeking mine own profit, but
the profit of many, that they may be saved.&rsquo;&nbsp; Noble words,
and inspiring to read.&nbsp; Yes: but look within, and think what Paul
must have passed through; think what he must have been put through before
he,&mdash;a man of like selfish passions as we are, a man of like selfish
passions as Anything was,&mdash;could say all that.&nbsp; Let his crosses
and his thorns; his raptures up to the third heaven, and his body of
death that he bore about with him all his days; let his magnificent
spiritual gifts, and his still more magnificent spiritual graces tell
how they all worked together to make the chief of sinners out of the
blameless Pharisee, and, at the same time, Christ&rsquo;s own chosen
vessel and the apostle of all the churches.&nbsp; Boasting about his
patron apostle, St. Augustine says: &lsquo;Far be it from so great an
apostle, a vessel elect of God, an organ of the Holy Ghost, to be one
man when he preached and another when he wrote; one man in private and
another in public.&nbsp; He was made all things to all men, not by the
craft of a deceiver, but from the affection of a sympathiser, succouring
the diverse diseases of souls with the diverse emotions of compassion;
to the little ones dispensing the lesser doctrines, not false ones,
but the higher mysteries to the perfect&mdash;all of them, however,
true, harmonious, and divine.&rsquo;&nbsp; The exquisite irony of Socrates
comes into my mind in this connection, and will not be kept out of my
mind.&nbsp; By instinct as well as by art Socrates mixed up the profoundest
seriousness with the humorous affectation of qualities of mind and even
of character the exact opposite of what all who loved him knew to be
the real Socrates.&nbsp; &lsquo;Intellectually,&rsquo; says Dr. Thomson,
&lsquo;the acutest man of his age, Socrates represents himself in all
companies as the dullest person present.&nbsp; Morally the purest, he
affects to be the slave of passion and borrows the language even of
the lewd to describe a love and a good-will far too exalted for the
comprehension of his contemporaries.&nbsp; This irony of his disarmed
ridicule by anticipating it; it allayed jealousy and propitiated envy;
and it possibly procured him admission into gay circles from which a
more solemn teacher would have been excluded.&nbsp; But all the time
it had for its basis a real greatness of soul, a hearty and an unaffected
disregard of public opinion, a perfect disinterestedness, and an entire
abnegation of self.&nbsp; He made himself a fool in order that fools
by his folly might be made wise; he humbled himself to the level of
those among whom his work lay that he might raise some few among them
to his own level; he was all things to all men, if by any means he might
save some.&nbsp; Till Alcibiades ends the splendid eloge that Plato
puts into his mouth with these words, &ldquo;All my master&rsquo;s vice
and stupidity and worship of wealthy and great men is counterfeit.&nbsp;
It is all but the Silenus-mask which conceals the features of the god
within; for if you remove the covering, how shall I describe to you,
my friends and boon companions, the excellence of the beauty you will
find within!&nbsp; Whether any of you have seen Socrates in his serious
mood, when he has thrown aside the mask and disclosed the divine features
beneath it, is more than I know.&nbsp; But I have seen them, and I can
tell you that they seemed to me glorious and marvellous, and, truly,
godlike in their beauty.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p>Well, now, I gather out of all that this great lesson: that it is,
to begin with, a mere matter of temperament, or what William Law would
call a mere matter of complexion and sensibility, whether, to begin
with, a man is hard, and dry, and narrow, and stiff, and proud, and
scornful, and cruel; or again, whether he is soft and tender, broad
and open, and full of sympathy and of the milk of human kindness.&nbsp;
At first, and to begin with, there is neither praise nor blame as yet
in the matter.&nbsp; A man is hard just as a stone is hard; it is his
nature.&nbsp; Or he is soft as clay is soft; it is again his nature.&nbsp;
But, inheriting such a nature, and his inherited nature beginning to
appear, then is the time when the true man really begins to be made.&nbsp;
The bad man dwells in contentment, and, indeed, by preference, at home
in his own hard, proud, scornful, resentful heart; or, again, in his
facile, fawning, tide-waiting, time-serving heart; and thus he chooses,
accepts, and prefers his evil fate, and never seeks the help either
of God or man to enable him to rise above it.&nbsp; Paul was not, when
we meet him first, the sweet, humble, affable, placable, makeable man
that he made himself and came to be after a lifetime of gospel-preaching
and of adorning the gospel he preached.&nbsp; And all the assistances
and all the opportunities that came to Paul are still coming to you
and to me; till, whether naturally pliable and affectionate or the opposite,
we at last shall come to the temperament, the complexion, and the exquisite
sensibility of Paul himself.&nbsp; Are you, then, a hard, stiff, severe,
censorious, proud, angry, scornful man?&nbsp; Or are you a too-easy,
too-facile man-pleaser and self-seeker, being all things to all men
that you may make use of all men?&nbsp; Are you?&nbsp; Then say so.&nbsp;
Confess it to be so.&nbsp; Admit that you have found yourself out.&nbsp;
And reflect every day what you have got to do in life.&nbsp; Consider
what a new birth you need and must have.&nbsp; Number your days that
are left you in which to make you a new heart, and a new nature, and
a new character.&nbsp; Consider well how you are to set about that divine
work.&nbsp; You have a minister, and your minister is called a divine
because by courtesy he is supposed to understand that divine work, and
to be engaged on it night and day in himself, and in season and out
of season among his people.&nbsp; He will tell you how you are to make
you a new heart.&nbsp; Or, if he does not and cannot do that; if he
preaches about everything but that to a people who will listen to anything
but that, then your soul is not in his hands but in your own.&nbsp;
You may not be able to choose your minister, but you can choose what
books you are to buy, or borrow, and read.&nbsp; And if there is not
a minister within a hundred miles of you who knows his right hand from
his left, then there are surely some booksellers who will advise you
about the classical books of the soul till you can order them for yourselves.&nbsp;
And thus, if it is your curse and your shame to be as spongy, and soapy,
and oily, and slippery as Anything himself; if you choose your church
and your reading with any originality, sense, and insight, you need
not fear but that you will be let live till you die an honest, upright,
honourable, fearless gentleman: no timid friend to unfashionable truth,
as you are to-night, but a man like Thomas Boston&rsquo;s Ettrick elder,
who lies waiting the last trump under a gravestone engraven with this
legend: Here lies a man who had a brow for every good cause.&nbsp; Only,
if you would have that written and read on your headstone, you have
no time to lose.&nbsp; If I were you I would not sit another Sabbath
under a minister whose preaching was not changing my nature, making
my heart new, and transforming my character; no, not though the Queen
herself sat in the same loft.&nbsp; And I would leave the church even
of my fathers, and become anything as far as churches go, if I could
get a minister who held my face close and ever closer up to my own heart.&nbsp;
Nor would I spend a shilling or an hour that I could help on any impertinent
book,&mdash;any book that did not powerfully help me in the one remaining
interest of my one remaining life: a new nature and a new heart.&nbsp;
No, not I.&nbsp; No, not I any more.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER X&mdash;CLIP-PROMISE</h2>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo; . . . the promise made of none effect.&rsquo;&mdash;<i>Paul</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Toward the end of the thirteenth century Edward the First, the English
Justinian, brought a select colony of artists from Italy to England
and gave them a commission to execute their best coinage for the English
Mint.&nbsp; Deft and skilful as those artists were, the work they turned
out was but rude and clumsy compared with some of the gold and silver
and copper coins of our day.&nbsp; The Florentine artists took a sheet
of gold or of silver and divided the sheet up with great scissors, and
then they hammered the cut-out pieces as only a Florentine hammerman
could hammer them.&nbsp; But, working with such tools, and working on
such methods, those goldsmiths and silversmiths, with all their art,
found it impossible to give an absolutely equal weight and worth to
every piece of money that they turned out.&nbsp; For one thing, their
cut and hammered coins had no carved rims round their edges as all our
gold and silver and even copper coinage now has.&nbsp; And, accordingly,
the clever rogues of that day soon discovered that it was far easier
for them to take up a pair of shears and to clip a sliver of silver
off the rough rim of a shilling, or a shaving of gold off a sovereign,
than it was to take of their coats and work a hard day&rsquo;s work.&nbsp;
Till to clip the coin of the realm soon became one of the easiest and
most profitable kinds of crime.&nbsp; In the time of Elizabeth a great
improvement was made in the way of coining the public money; but it
was soon found that this had only made matters worse.&nbsp; For now,
side by side with a pure and unimpaired and full-valued currency, and
mingled up everywhere with it, there was the old, clipped, debased,
and far too light gold and silver money; till troubles arose in connection
with the coinage and circulation of the country that can only be told
by Macaulay&rsquo;s extraordinarily graphic pen.&nbsp; &lsquo;It may
well be doubted,&rsquo; Macaulay says, in the twenty-first chapter of
his <i>History of England</i>, &lsquo;whether all the misery which has
been inflicted on the English nation in a quarter of a century by bad
Kings, bad Ministers, bad Parliaments, and bad Judges was equal to the
misery caused in a single year by bad crowns and bad shillings.&nbsp;
Whether Whigs or Tories, Protestants or Papists were uppermost, the
grazier drove his beasts to market, the grocer weighed out his currants,
the draper measured out his broadcloth, the hum of buyers and sellers
was as loud as ever in the towns; the cream overflowed the pails of
Cheshire; the apple juice foamed in the presses of Herefordshire; the
piles of crockery glowed in the furnaces of the Trent, and the barrows
of coal rolled fast along the timber railways of the Tyne.&nbsp; But
when the great instrument of exchange became thoroughly deranged all
trade and all industry were smitten as with a palsy.&nbsp; Nothing could
be purchased without a dispute.&nbsp; Over every counter there was wrangling
from morning to night.&nbsp; The employer and his workmen had a quarrel
as regularly as Saturday night came round.&nbsp; On a fair day or a
market day the clamours, the disputes, the reproaches, the taunts, the
curses, were incessant.&nbsp; No merchant would contract to deliver
goods without making some stipulation about the quality of the coin
in which he was to be paid.&nbsp; The price of the necessaries of life,
of shoes, of ale, of oatmeal, rose fast.&nbsp; The bit of metal called
a shilling the labourer found would not go so far as sixpence.&nbsp;
One day Tonson sends forty brass shillings to Dryden, to say nothing
of clipped money.&nbsp; The great poet sends them all back and demands
in their place good guineas.&nbsp; &ldquo;I expect,&rdquo; he says,
&ldquo;good silver, not such as I had formerly.&rdquo;&nbsp; Meanwhile,
at every session of the Old Bailey the most terrible example of coiners
and clippers was made.&nbsp; Hurdles, with four, five, six wretches
convicted of counterfeiting or mutilating the money of the realm, were
dragged month after month up Holborn Hill.&rsquo;&nbsp; But I cannot
copy the whole chapter, wonderful as the writing is.&nbsp; Suffice it
to say that before the clippers could be rooted out, and confidence
restored between buyer and seller, the greatest statesmen, the greatest
financiers, and the greatest philosophers were all at their wits&rsquo;
end.&nbsp; Kings&rsquo; speeches, cabinet councils, bills of Parliament,
and showers of pamphlets were all full in those days of the clipper
and the coiner.&nbsp; All John Locke&rsquo;s great intellect came short
of grappling successfully with the terrible crisis the clipper of the
coin had brought upon England.&nbsp; Carry all that, then, over into
the life of personal religion, after the manner of our Lord&rsquo;s
parables, and after the manner of the <i>Pilgrim&rsquo;s Progress</i>
and the <i>Holy War</i>, and you will see what an able and impressive
use John Bunyan will make of the shears of the coin-clippers of his
day.&nbsp; Macaulay has but made us ready to open and understand Bunyan.&nbsp;
&lsquo;After this, my Lord apprehended Clip-Promise.&nbsp; Now, because
he was a notorious villain, for by his doings much of the king&rsquo;s
coin was abused, therefore he was made a public example.&nbsp; He was
arraigned and judged to be set first in the pillory, then to be whipped
by all the children and servants in Mansoul, and then to be hanged till
he was dead.&nbsp; Some may wonder at the severity of this man&rsquo;s
punishment, but those that are honest traders in Mansoul they are sensible
of the great abuse that one clipper of promises in little time may do
in the town of Mansoul; and, truly, my judgment is that all those of
his name and life should be served out even as he.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The grace of God is like a bullion mass of purest gold, and then
Jesus Christ is the great ingot of that gold, and then Moses, and David,
and Isaiah, and Hosea, and Paul, and Peter, and John are the inspired
artists who have commission to take both bullion and ingot, and out
of them to cut, and beat, and smelt, and shape, and stamp, and superscribe
the promises, and then to issue the promises to pass current in the
market of salvation like so many shekels, and pounds, and pence, and
farthings, and mites, as the case may be.&nbsp; And it was just these
royal coins, imaged and superscribed so richly and so beautifully, that
Clip-Promise so mutilated, abused, and debased, till for doing so he
was hanged by the neck till he was dead.</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; The very house of Israel herself, the very Mint-house, Tower
Hill, and Lombard Street of Israel herself, was full of false coiners
and clippers of the promises; as full as ever England was at her very
worst.&nbsp; Israel clipped her Messianic promises and lived upon the
clippings instead of upon the coin.&nbsp; Her coming Christ, and His
salvation already begun, were the true spiritual currency of Old Testament
times; while round that central Image of her great promise there ran
an outside rim of lesser promises that all took their true and their
only value from Him whose image and superscription stood within.&nbsp;
But those besotted and infatuated men of Israel, instead of entering
into and living by the great spiritual promises given to them in their
Messiah, made lands, and houses, and meat, and drink, all the Messiah
they cared for.&nbsp; Matthew Henry says that when we go to the merchant
to buy goods, he gives us the paper and the pack-thread to the bargain.&nbsp;
Well, those children and fools in Israel actually threw away the goods
and hoarded and boasted over the paper and the pack-thread.&nbsp; Our
old Scottish lawyers have made us familiar with the distinction in the
church between <i>spiritualia</i> and <i>temporalia</i>.&nbsp; Well,
the Jews let the <i>spiritualia</i> go to those who cared to take such
things, while they held fast to the <i>temporalia</i>.&nbsp; And all
that went on till His disciples had the effrontery to clip and coin
under our Lord&rsquo;s very eyes, and even to ask Him to hold the coin
while they sharpened their shears.&nbsp; &lsquo;O faithless and perverse
generation!&nbsp; How long shall I be with you?&nbsp; How long shall
I suffer you?&nbsp; Have I been so long with you, and yet hast thou
not known Me, Philip?&nbsp; O fools, and slow of heart to believe all
that the prophets have spoken!&nbsp; And beginning at Moses and all
the prophets He expounded to them in all the Scriptures the things concerning
Himself.&rsquo;</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; But those who live in glass houses must take care not to
throw stones.&nbsp; And thus the greatest fool in Israel is safe from
you and me.&nbsp; For, like them, and just as if we had never read one
word about them, we bend our hearts and our children&rsquo;s hearts
to things seen and temporal, and then, after things seen and temporal
have all cast us off, we begin to ask if there is any solace or sweetness
for a cast-off heart in things unseen and eternal.&nbsp; There are great
gaps clipt out of our Bibles that not God Himself can ever print or
paste in again.&nbsp; Look and see if half the Book of Proverbs, for
instance, with all its noble promises to a godly youth, is not clipt
clean out of your dismembered Bible.&nbsp; That fine leaf also, &lsquo;My
son, give Me thine heart,&rsquo; is clean gone out of the twenty-third
chapter of the Proverbs years and years ago.&nbsp; As is the best part
of the noble Book of Daniel, and almost the whole of Second Timothy.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Seek ye first the Kingdom of God and His righteousness, and meat
and drink, and wife and child shall be added unto you.&rsquo;&nbsp;
Your suicidal shears have cut that golden promise for ever out of your
Sermon on the Mount.&nbsp; So much so that if any or all of these temporal
mercies ever come to you, they will come of pure and undeserved mercy,
for the time has long passed when you could plead any promise for them.&nbsp;
Still, there are two most excellent uses left to which you can even
yet put your mangled and dismembered Bible.&nbsp; You can make a splendid
use of its gaps and of its gashes, and of those waste places where great
promises at one time stood.&nbsp; You can make a grand use even of those
gaps if you will descend into them and draw out of them humiliation
and repentance, compunction, contrition, and resignation.&nbsp; And
this use also: When you are moved to take some man who is still young
into your confidence, ask him to let you see his Bible and then let
him see yours, and point out to him the rents and wounds and wilderness
places in yours.&nbsp; And thus, by these two uses of a clipped-up and
half-empty Bible, you may make gains that shall yet set you above those
whose Bibles of promises are still as fresh as when they came from God&rsquo;s
own hand.&nbsp; And Samson said, I will now put forth a riddle unto
you: Out of the eater came forth meat, and out of the strong came forth
sweetness.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; &lsquo;Go out,&rsquo; said the Lord of Mansoul, &lsquo;and
apprehend Clip-Promise and bring him before me.&rsquo;&nbsp; And they
did so.&nbsp; &lsquo;Go down to Edinburgh to-night, and go to the door
of such and such a church, and, as he comes out arrest Clip-the-Commandments,
for he has heard My word all this day again but will not do it.&rsquo;&nbsp;
Where would you be by midnight if God rose up in anger and swore at
this moment that your disobedient time should be no longer?&nbsp; You
would be speechless before such a charge, for the shears are in your
pocket at this moment with which you have clipped to pieces this Sabbath-day:
shears red with the blood of the Fourth Commandment.&nbsp; For, when
did you rise off your bed this resurrection morning?&nbsp; And what
did you do when you did rise?&nbsp; What has your reading and your conversation
been this whole Lord&rsquo;s day?&nbsp; How full your heart would have
been of faith and love and holiness by this time of night had you not
despised the Lord of the Sabbath, and cast all His commandments and
opportunities to you behind your back?&nbsp; What private exercise have
you had all day with your Father who sees in secret?&nbsp; How often
have you been on your knees, and where, and how long, and for what,
and for whom?&nbsp; What work of mercy have you done to-day, or determined
to do to-morrow?&nbsp; And so with all the divine commandments: Mosaic
and Christian, legal and evangelical.&nbsp; Such as: A tenth of all
I have given to thee; a covenant with a wandering eye; a mouth once
speaking evil, is it now well watched? not one vessel only, but all
the vessels of thy body sanctified till every thought and imagination
is well under the obedience of Christ.&nbsp; Lest His anger for all
that begin to burn to-night, make your bed with Eli and Samuel in His
sanctuary to-night, lest the avenger of the blood of the commandments
leap out on you in your sleep!</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; The Old Serpent took with him the great shears of hell,
and clipped &lsquo;Thou shalt surely die&rsquo; out of the second chapter
of Genesis.&nbsp; And the same enemy of mankind will clip all the terror
of the Lord out of your heart to-night again, if he can.&nbsp; And he
will do it in this way, if he can.&nbsp; He will have some one at the
church door ready and waiting for you.&nbsp; As soon as the blessing
is pronounced, some one will take you by the arm and will entertain
you with the talk you love, or that you once loved, till you will be
ashamed to confess that there is any terror or turning to God in your
heart.&nbsp; No!&nbsp; Thou shalt not surely die, says the serpent still.&nbsp;
Why, hast thou not trampled Sabbaths and sermons past counting under
thy feet?&nbsp; What commandment, laid on body or soul, hast thou not
broken, and thou art still adding drunkenness to thirst, and God doth
not know!&nbsp; &lsquo;The woman said unto the serpent, We may not eat
of it, neither may we touch it, lest we die.&nbsp; And the serpent said
unto the woman, Ye shall not surely die.&rsquo;</p>
<p>5.&nbsp; You must all have heard of Clito, who used to say that he
desired no more time for rising and dressing and saying his prayers
than about a quarter of an hour.&nbsp; Well, that was clipping the thing
pretty close, wasn&rsquo;t it?&nbsp; At the same time it must be admitted
that a good deal of prayer may be got through in a quarter of an hour
if you do not lose any moment of it.&nbsp; Especially in the first quarter
of the day, if you are expeditious enough to begin to pray before you
even begin to dress.&nbsp; And prayer is really a very strange experience.&nbsp;
There are things about prayer that no man has yet fully found out or
told to any.&nbsp; For one thing, once well began it grows upon a man
in a most extraordinary and unheard-of way.&nbsp; This same Clito for
instance, some time after we find him at his prayers before his eyes
are open; and then he keeps all morning making his bath, his soap, his
towels, his brushes, and his clothes all one long artifice of prayer.&nbsp;
And that till there is not a single piece of his dressing-room furniture
that is not ready to swear at the last day that its master long before
he died had become a man full of secret prayer.&nbsp; There is a fountain
filled with blood! he exclaims, as he throws himself into his bath;
and Jeremiah second and twenty-second he uses regularly to repeat to
himself half a dozen times a day as he washes the smoke and dust of
the city off his hands and face.&nbsp; And then Revelation third and
eighteenth till his toilet is completed.&nbsp; Nay, this same Clito
has come to be such a devotee to that he had at one time been so expeditious
with, that I have seen him forget himself on the street and think that
his door was shut.&nbsp; But there is really no use telling you all
that about Clito.&nbsp; For, till you try closet-prayer for yourself,
all that God or man can say to you on that subject will be water spilt
on the ground.&nbsp; All we can say is, Try it.&nbsp; Begin it.&nbsp;
Some desperate day try it.&nbsp; Stop when you are on the way to the
pond and try it.&nbsp; Stop when you are fastening up the rope and try
it.&nbsp; When the poison is moving in the cup, stop, shut your door
first.&nbsp; Try God first.&nbsp; See if He is still waiting.&nbsp;
And, always after, when the steel shears of a too early, too crowded,
and far too exacting day are clipping you out of all time for prayer,
then what should you do?&nbsp; What do you do when you simply cannot
get your proper fresh air and exercise everyday?&nbsp; Do you not fall
back on the plasticity and pliability of nature and take your air and
exercise in large parcels?&nbsp; You take a ride into the country two
or three times a week.&nbsp; Or, two afternoons a week you have ten
miles alone if you cannot get a godly friend.&nbsp; And then two or
three times a year, if you can afford it, you climb an Alp or a Grampian
every day for a week or a month; and, so gracious and so adaptable is
human nature, that, what others get daily, you get weekly, or monthly,
or quarterly, or yearly.&nbsp; And, though a soul is not to be too much
presumed upon, Clito came to tell his friends that his soul could on
occasion take in prayer and praise enough for a week in a single morning
or afternoon, and, almost, for a whole year in a good holiday.&nbsp;
As Christ Himself did when He said: Come away apart into a desert place
and rest a while; for there are so many people coming and going here
that we have no time so much as to eat.</p>
<p>6.&nbsp; But I see I must clip off my last point with you, which
was to tell you what you already know only too well, and that is, what
terrible shears a bad conscience is armed with, and what havoc she makes
at all ages of a poor sinner&rsquo;s Bible.&nbsp; But you can spare
that head.&nbsp; You can preach on that text to yourselves far better
than all your ministers.&nbsp; Only, take home with you these two lines
I have clipped out of Fraser of Brea for you.&nbsp; Nothing in man,
he says to us, is to be a ground of despair, since the whole ground
of all our hope is in Christ alone.&nbsp; Christ&rsquo;s relation is
always to men as they are sinners and not as they are righteous.&nbsp;
I came not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis
with sinners, then, Christ has to do.&nbsp; Nothing damns but unbelief;
and unbelief is just holding back from pressing God with this promise,
that Christ came to save sinners.&nbsp; This is a faithful saying, and
worthy of all acceptation, and it is still to be found standing in the
most clipped-up Bible, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save
sinners; of whom I am chief.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XI&mdash;STIFF MR. LOTH-TO-STOOP</h2>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Thy neck is an iron sinew.&rsquo;&mdash;<i>Jehovah

<p>&lsquo;King Zedekiah humbled not himself, but stiffened his neck.&rsquo;&mdash;<i>The
Chronicles</i>.</p>
<p>&lsquo;He humbled himself.&rsquo;&mdash;<i>Paul on our Lord</i>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>All John Bunyan&rsquo;s Characters, Situations, and Episodes are
collected into this house to-night.&nbsp; Obstinate and Pliable are
here; Passion and Patience; Simple, Sloth, and Presumption; Madame Bubble
and Mr. Worldly-wiseman; Talkative and By-ends; Deaf Mr. Prejudice is
here also, and, sitting close beside him, stiff Mr. Loth-to-stoop; while
good old Mr. Wet-eyes and young Captain Self-denial are not wholly wanting.&nbsp;
It gives this house an immense and an ever-green interest to me to see
character after character coming trooping in, Sabbath evening after
Sabbath evening, each man to see himself and his neighbour in John Bunyan&rsquo;s
so truthful and so fearless glass.&nbsp; But it stabs me to the heart
with a mortal stab to see how few of us out of this weekly congregation
are any better men after all we come to see and to hear.&nbsp; At the
same time, such a constant dropping will surely in time wear away the
hardest rock.&nbsp; Let that so stiff old man, then, stiff old Mr. Loth-to-stoop,
came forward and behold his natural face in John Bunyan&rsquo;s glass
again to-night.&nbsp; &lsquo;Lord, is it I?&rsquo; was a very good question,
though put by a very bad man.&nbsp; Let us, one and all, then, put the
traitor&rsquo;s question to ourselves to-night.&nbsp; Am I stiff old
Loth-to-stoop?&mdash;let every man in this house say to himself all
through this service, and then at home when reviewing the day, and then
all to-morrow when to stoop will be so loathsome and so impossible to
us all.</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; To begin, then, at the very bottom of this whole matter,
take stiff old Loth-to-stoop as a guilty sinner in the sight of God.&nbsp;
Let us take this stiff old man in this dreadful character to begin with,
because it is in this deepest and most dreadful aspect of his nature
and his character that he is introduced to us in the <i>Holy War</i>.&nbsp;
And I shall stand aside and let John Bunyan himself describe Loth-to-stoop
in the matter of his justification before God.&nbsp; &lsquo;That is
a great stoop for a sinner to have to take,&rsquo; says our apostolic
author in another classical place, &lsquo;a too great stoop to have
to suffer the total loss of all his own righteousness, and, actually,
to have to look to another for absolutely everything of that kind.&nbsp;
That is no easy matter for any man to do.&nbsp; I assure you it stretches
every vein in his heart before he will be brought to yield to that.&nbsp;
What! for a man to deny, reject, abhor, and throw away all his prayers,
tears, alms, keeping of Sabbaths, hearing, reading, and all the rest,
and to admit both himself and them to be abominable and accursed, and
to be willing in the very midst of his sins to throw himself wholly
upon the righteousness and obedience of another man!&nbsp; I say to
do that in deed and in truth is the biggest piece of the cross, and
therefore it is that Paul calls it a suffering.&nbsp; &ldquo;I have
suffered the loss of all things that I might win Christ, and be found
in Him, not having mine own righteousness.&rdquo;&rsquo;&nbsp; That
is John Bunyan&rsquo;s characteristic comment on stiff old Loth-to-stoop
as a guilty sinner, with the offer of a full forgiveness set before
him.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; And then our so truthful and so fertile author goes on to
give us Loth-to-stoop as a half-saved sinner; a sinner, that is, trying
to make his own terms with God about his full salvation.&nbsp; Through
three most powerful pages we see stiff old Loth-to-stoop engaged in
beating down God&rsquo;s unalterable terms of salvation, and in bidding
for his full salvation upon his own reduced and easy terms.&nbsp; It
was the tremendous stoop of the Son of God from the throne of God to
the cradle and the carpenter&rsquo;s shop; and then, as if that were
not enough, it was that other tremendous stoop of His down to the Garden
and the Cross,&mdash;it was these two so tremendous stoops of Jesus
Christ that made stiff old Loth-to-stoop&rsquo;s salvation even possible.&nbsp;
But, with all that, his true salvation was not possible without stoop
after stoop of his own; stoop after stoop which, if not so tremendous
as those of Christ, were yet tremendous enough, and too tremendous,
for him.&nbsp; Old Loth-to-stoop carries on a long and a bold debate
with Emmanuel in order to lessen the stoop that Emmanuel demands of
him; and your own life and mine, my brethren, at their deepest and at
their closest to our own heart, are really at bottom, like Loth-to-stoop&rsquo;s
life, one long roup of salvation, in which God tries to get us up to
His terms and in which we try to get Him down to our terms.&nbsp; His
terms are, that we shall sell absolutely all that we have for the salvation
of our souls; and our terms are, salvation or no salvation, to keep
all that we have and to seek every day for more.&nbsp; God absolutely
demands that we shall stoop to the very dust every day, till we become
the poorest, the meanest, the most despicable, and the most hopeless
of men; whereas we meet that divine demand with the proud reply&mdash;Is
Thy servant a dog?&nbsp; It was with this offended mind that stiff old
Loth-to-stoop at last left off from Emmanuel&rsquo;s presence; he would
die rather than come down to such degrading terms.&nbsp; And as Loth-to-stoop
went away, Emmanuel looked after him, well remembering the terrible
night when He Himself was, not indeed like Loth-to-stoop, nor near like
him, but when His own last stoop was so deep that it made Him cry out,
Father, save Me from this hour! and again, If it be possible let this
so tremendous stoop pass from Me.&nbsp; For a moment Emmanuel Himself
was loth to stoop, but only for a moment.&nbsp; For He soon rose from
off His face in a bath of blood, saying, Not My will, but Thine be done!&nbsp;
When Thomas &Agrave; Kempis is negotiating with the Loth-to-stoops of
his unevangelical day, we hear him saying to them things like this:
&lsquo;Jesus Christ was despised of men, forsaken of His friends and
lovers, and in the midst of slanders.&nbsp; He was willing, under His
Father&rsquo;s will, to suffer and to be despised, and darest thou to
complain of any man&rsquo;s usage of thee?&nbsp; Christ, thy Master,
had enemies and back-biters, and dost thou expect to have all men to
be thy friends and benefactors?&nbsp; Whence shall thy patience attain
her promised crown if no adversity befall thee?&nbsp; Suffer thou with
Jesus Christ, and for His sake, if thou wouldst reign with Him.&nbsp;
Set thyself, therefore, to bear manfully the cross of thy Lord, who,
out of love, was crucified for thee.&nbsp; Know for certain that thou
must lead a daily dying life.&nbsp; And the more that thou diest to
thyself all that the more shalt thou live unto God.&rsquo;&nbsp; With
many such words as these did Thomas teach the saints of his day to stoop
to their daily cross; a daily cross then, which has now been for long
to him and to them an everlasting crown.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; And speaking of &Agrave; Kempis, and having lately read
some of his most apposite chapters, such as that on the Holy Fathers
and that on Obedience and Subjection, leads me on to look at Loth-to-stoop
when he enters the sacred ministry, as he sometimes does.&nbsp; When
a half-converted, half-subdued, half-saved sinner gets himself called
to the sacred ministry his office will either greatly hasten on his
salvation, or else it will greatly hinder and endanger it.&nbsp; He
will either stoop down every day to deeper and ever deeper depths of
humility, or he will tower up in pride of office and in pride of heart
past all hope of humility, and thus of salvation.&nbsp; The holy ministry
is a great nursing-house of pride as we see in a long line of popes,
and prelates, and priests, and other lords over God&rsquo;s heritage.&nbsp;
And our own Presbyterian polity, while it hands down to us the simplicity,
the unity, the brotherhood, and the humility of the apostolic age, at
the same time leaves plenty of temptation and plenty of opportunity
for the pride of the human heart.&nbsp; Our preaching and pastoral office,
when it is aright laid to our hearts, will always make us the meekest
and the humblest of men, even when we carry the most magnificent of
messages.&nbsp; But when our own hearts are not right the very magnificence
of our message, and the very authority of our Master, become all so
many subtle temptations to pride, pique, self-importance, and lothness-to-stoop.&nbsp;
With so much still to learn, how slow we ministers are to stoop to learn!&nbsp;
How still we stand, and even go back, when all other men are going forward!&nbsp;
How few of us have made the noble resolution of Jonathan Edwards: &lsquo;Resolved,&rsquo;
he wrote, &lsquo;that, as old men have seldom any advantage of new discoveries
because these are beside a way of thinking they have been long used
to: resolved, therefore, if ever I live to years, that I shall be impartial
to hear the reasons of all pretended discoveries, and to receive them,
if rational how long soever I have been used to another way of thinking.&rsquo;&nbsp;
Let all ministers, then, young and old, resolve to stoop with Jonathan
Edwards, who shines, in his life and in his works, like the cherubim
with knowledge, and burns like the seraphim with love.</p>
<p>And then, when, not having so resolved, our thin vein of youthful
knowledge and experience has been worked to the rock; when grey hairs
are here and there upon us, how slow we are to stoop to that!&nbsp;
How unwilling we are to let it light on our hearts that our time is
past; that we are no longer able to understand, or interest, or attract
the young; and, besides, that that is not all their blame, no, nor ours
either, but simply the order and method of Divine Providence.&nbsp;
How slow we are to see that Divine Providence has other men standing
ready to take up our work if we would only humbly lay it down;&mdash;how
loth we are to stoop to see all that!&nbsp; How unwilling we are to
make up our minds, we old and ageing ministers, and to humble our hearts
to accept an assistant or to submit to a colleague to stand alongside
of us in our unaccomplished work!</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; In public life also, as we call it, what disasters to the
state, to the services, and to society, are constantly caused by this
same Loth-to-stoop!&nbsp; When he holds any public office; when he becomes
the leader of a party; when he is promoted to be an adviser of the Crown;
when he is put at the head of a fleet of ships, or of an army of men,
what untold evils does Loth-to-stoop bring both on himself and on the
nation!&nbsp; An old statesman will have committed himself to some line
of legislation or of administration; a great captain will have committed
himself to some manoeuvre of a squadron or of a division, or to some
plan of battle, and some subordinate will have discovered the error
his leader has made, and will be bold to point it out to him.&nbsp;
But stiff old Loth-to-stoop has taken his line and has passed his word.&nbsp;
His honour, as he holds it, is committed to this announced line of action;
and, if the Crown itself should perish before his policy, he will not
stoop to change it.&nbsp; How often you see that in great affairs as
well as in small.&nbsp; How seldom you see a public man openly confessing
that he has hitherto all along been wrong, and that he has at last and
by others been set right.&nbsp; Not once in a generation.&nbsp; But
even that once redeems public life; it ennobles public life; and it
saves the nation and the sovereign who possess such a true patriot.&nbsp;
Consistency and courage, independence and dignity, are high-sounding
words; but openness of mind, teachableness, diffidence, and humility
always go with true nobility as well as with ultimate success and lasting
honour.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XII&mdash;THAT VARLET ILL-PAUSE, THE DEVIL&rsquo;S ORATOR</h2>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;I made haste and delayed not.&rsquo;&mdash;<i>David</i>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>John Bunyan shall himself introduce, describe, and characterise this
varlet, this devil&rsquo;s ally and accomplice, this ancient enemy of
Mansoul, whose name is Ill-pause.&nbsp; Well, this same Ill-pause, says
our author, was the orator of Diabolus on all difficult occasions, nor
took Diabolus any other one with him on difficult occasions, but just
Ill-pause alone.&nbsp; And always when Diabolus had any special plot
a-foot against Mansoul, and when the thing went as Diabolus would have
it go, then would Ill-pause stand up, for he was Diabolus his orator.&nbsp;
When Mansoul was under siege of Emmanuel his four noble captains sent
a message to the men of the town that if they would only throw Ill-pause
over the wall to them, that they might reward him according to his works,
then they would hold a parley with the city; but if this varlet was
to be let live in the city, then, why, the city must see to the consequences.&nbsp;
At which Diabolus, who was there present, was loth to lose his orator,
because, had the four captains once laid their fingers on Ill-pause,
be sure his master had lost his orator.&nbsp; And, then, in the last
assault, we read that Ill-pause, the orator that came along with Diabolus,
he also received a grievous wound in the head, some say that his brain-pan
was cracked.&nbsp; This, at any rate, I have taken notice of, that never
after this was he able to do that mischief to Mansoul as he had done
in times past.&nbsp; And then there was also at Eye-gate that Ill-pause
of whom you have heard before.&nbsp; The same was he that was orator
to Diabolus.&nbsp; He did much mischief to the town of Mansoul, till
at last he fell by the hand of the Captain Good-hope.</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; Well, to begin with, this Ill-pause was a filthy Diabolonian
varlet; a treacherous and a villainous old varlet, the author of the
<i>Holy War</i> calls him.&nbsp; Now, what is a varlet?&nbsp; Well,
a varlet is just a broken-down old valet.&nbsp; A varlet is a valet
who has come down, and down, and down, and down again in the world,
till, from once having been the servant and the trusty friend of the
very best of masters, he has come to be the ally and accomplice of the
very worst of masters.&nbsp; His first name, the name of his first office,
still sticks to him, indeed; but, like himself, and with himself, his
name has become depraved and corrupted till you would not know it.&nbsp;
A varlet, then, is just short and sharp for a scoundrel who is ready
for anything; and the worse the thing is the more ready he is for it.&nbsp;
There are riff-raff and refuse always about who are ready to volunteer
for any filibustering expedition; and that full as much for the sheer
devilry of the enterprise as for any real profit it is to be to themselves.&nbsp;
Wherever mischief is to be done, there your true varlet is sure to turn
up.&nbsp; Well, just such a land-shark was this Ill-pause, who was such
an ally and accomplice to Diabolus that he had need for no other.&nbsp;
What possible certificate in evil could exceed this&mdash;that the devil
took not any with him when he went out on his worst errand but this
same Ill-pause, who was his orator on all his most difficult occasions?</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; Ill-pause was a varlet, then, and he was also an orator.&nbsp;
Now, an orator, as you know, is a great speaker.&nbsp; An orator is
a man who has the excellent and influential gift of public speech.&nbsp;
And on great occasions in public life when people are to be instructed,
and impressed, and moved, and won over, then the great orator sets up
his platform.&nbsp; Quintilian teaches us in his <i>Institutes</i> that
it is only a good man who can be a really great orator.&nbsp; What would
that fine writer have said had he lived to read the <i>Holy War</i>,
and seen the most successful of all orators that ever opened a mouth,
and who was all the time a diabolical old varlet?&nbsp; What would the
author of <i>The Education of an Orator</i> have said to that?&nbsp;
Diabolus did not on every occasion bring up his great orator Ill-pause.&nbsp;
He did not always come up himself, and he did not always send up Ill-pause.&nbsp;
It was only on difficult occasions that both Diabolus and his orator
also came up.&nbsp; You do not hear your great preachers every Sabbath.&nbsp;
They would not long remain great preachers, and you would soon cease
to pay any attention to them, if they were always in the pulpit.&nbsp;
Neither do you have your great orators at every street corner.&nbsp;
Their masters only build theatres for them when some great occasion
arises in the land, and when the best wisdom must straightway be spoken
to the people and in the best way.&nbsp; Then you bring up Quintilian&rsquo;s
orator if you have him at your call.&nbsp; As Diabolus has done from
time to time with his great and almost always successful orator Ill-pause.&nbsp;
On difficult occasions he came himself on the scene and Ill-pause with
him.&nbsp; On such difficult occasions as in the Garden of Eden; as
when Noah was told to make haste and build an ark; as also when Abraham
was told to make haste and leave his father&rsquo;s house; when Jacob
was bid remember and pay the vow he had made when his trouble was upon
him; as also when Joseph had to flee for what was better than life;
and on that memorable occasion when David sent Joab out against Rabbah,
but David tarried still at Jerusalem.&nbsp; On all these essential,
first-class, and difficult occasions the old serpent brought up Ill-pause.&nbsp;
As also when our Lord was in the wilderness; when He set His face to
go up to Jerusalem; when He saw certain Greeks among them that came
up to the passover; as also again and again in the Garden.&nbsp; As
also on crucial occasions in your own life.&nbsp; As when you had been
told not to eat, not to touch, and not even to look at the forbidden
fruit, then Ill-pause, the devil&rsquo;s orator, came to you and said
that it was a tree to be desired.&nbsp; And, you shall not surely die.&nbsp;
As also when you were moved to terror and to tears under a Sabbath,
or under a sermon, or at some death-bed, or on your own sick-bed&mdash;Ill-pause
got you to put off till a more convenient season your admitted need
of repentance and reformation and peace with God.&nbsp; On such difficult
occasions as these the devil took Ill-pause to help him with you, and
the result, from the devil&rsquo;s point of view, has justified his
confidence in his orator.&nbsp; When Ill-pause gets his new honours
paid him in hell; when there is a new joy in hell over another sinner
that has not yet repented, your name will be heard sounding among the
infernal cheers.&nbsp; Just think of your baptismal name and your pet
name at home giving them joy to-night at their supper in hell!&nbsp;
And yet one would not at first sight think that such triumphs and such
toasts, such medals, and clasps, and garters were to be won on earth
or in hell just by saying such simple-sounding and such commonplace
things as those are for which Ill-pause receives his decorations.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Take time,&rsquo; he says.&nbsp; &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; he admits,
&lsquo;but there is no such hurry; to-morrow will do; next year will
do; after you are old will do quite as well.&nbsp; The darkness shall
cover you, and your sin will not find you out.&nbsp; Christ died for
sin, and it is a faithful saying that His blood will cleanse you later
on from all this sin.&rsquo;&nbsp; Everyday and well-known words, indeed,
but a true orator is seen in nothing more than in this, that he can
take up what everybody knows and says, and put it so as to carry everybody
captive.&nbsp; One of Quintilian&rsquo;s own orators has said that a
great speaker only gives back to his hearers in flood what they have
already given to him in vapour.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; &lsquo;I was always pleased,&rsquo; says Calvin, &lsquo;with
that saying of Chrysostom, &ldquo;The foundation of our philosophy is
humility&rdquo;; and yet more pleased with that of Augustine: &ldquo;As,&rdquo;
says he, &ldquo;the rhetorician being asked, What was the first thing
in the rules of eloquence? he answered, Pronunciation; what was the
second? Pronunciation; what was the third? and still he answered, Pronunciation.&nbsp;
So if you would ask me concerning the precepts of the Christian religion,
I would answer, firstly, secondly, thirdly, and for ever, Humility.&rdquo;&rsquo;&nbsp;
And when Ill-pause opened his elocutionary school for the young orators
of hell, he is reported to have said this to them in his opening address,
&lsquo;There are only three things in my school,&rsquo; he said; &lsquo;three
rules, and no more to be called rules.&nbsp; The first is Delay, the
second is Delay, and the third is Delay.&nbsp; Study the art of delay,
my sons; make all your studies to tell on how to make the fools delay.&nbsp;
Only get those to whom your master sends you to delay, and you will
not need to envy me my laurels; you will soon have a shining crown of
your own.&nbsp; Get the father to delay teaching his little boy how
to pray.&nbsp; Get him on any pretext you can invent to put off speaking
in private to his son about his soul.&nbsp; Get him to delegate all
that to the minister.&nbsp; And then by hook or by crook get that son
as he grows up to put off the Lord&rsquo;s Supper.&nbsp; And after that
you will easily get him to put off purity and prayer till he is a married
man and at the head of a house.&nbsp; Only get the idea of a more convenient
season well into their heads, and their game is up, and your spurs are
won.&nbsp; Take their arm in yours, as I used to do, at their church
door, if you are posted there, and say to them as they come out that
to-morrow will be time enough to give what they had thought of giving
while they were still in their pew and the minister or missionary was
still in the pulpit.&nbsp; Only, as you value your master&rsquo;s praises
and the applause of all this place, keep them, at any cost, from striking
while the iron is hot.&nbsp; Let them fill their hearts, and their mouths
too, if it gives them any comfort, with the best intentions; only, my
scholars, remember that the beginning and middle and end of your office
is by hook or by crook to secure delay.&rsquo;&nbsp; And a great crop
of young orators sprang up ready for their work under that teaching
and out of the persuasionary school of Ill-pause.&nbsp; In fine, Mansoul
desired some time in which to prepare its answer.&rsquo;</p>
<p>There are many men among ourselves who have been bedevilled out of
their best life, out of the salvation of their souls, and out of all
that constitutes and accompanies salvation now for many years.&nbsp;
And still their sin-deceived hearts are saying to them to-night, Take
time!&nbsp; For many years, every new year, every birthday, and, for
a long time, every Communion-day, they were just about to be done with
their besetting sin; and now all the years lie behind them, one long
downward road all paved, down to this Sabbath night, with the best intentions.&nbsp;
And, still, as if that were not enough, that same varlet is squat at
their ear.&nbsp; Well, my very miserable brother, you have long talked
about the end of an old year and the beginning of a new year as being
your set time for repentance and for reformation.&nbsp; Let all the
weight of those so many remorseful years fall on your heart at the close
of this year, and at last compel you to take the step that should have
been taken, oh! so many unhappy years ago!&nbsp; Go straight home then,
to-night, shut your door, and, after so many desecrated Sabbath nights,
God will still meet you in your secret chamber.&nbsp; As soon as you
shut your door God will be with you, and you will be with God.&nbsp;
With GOD!&nbsp; Think of it, my brother, and the thing is done.&nbsp;
With GOD!&nbsp; And then tell Him all.&nbsp; And if any one knocks at
your door, say that there is Some One with you to-night, and that you
cannot come down.&nbsp; And continue till you have told it all to God.&nbsp;
He knows it all already; but that is one of Ill-pause&rsquo;s sophistries
still in your heart.&nbsp; Tell your Father it all.&nbsp; Tell Him how
many years it is.&nbsp; Tell Him all that you so well remember over
all those wild, miserable, mad, remorseful years.&nbsp; Tell Him that
you have not had one really happy, one really satisfied day all those
years, and tell Him that you have spent all, and are now no longer a
young man; youth and health and self-respect and self-command are all
gone, till you are a shipwreck rather than a man.&nbsp; And tell Him
that if He will take you back that you are to-night at His feet.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; &lsquo;We seldom overcome any one vice perfectly,&rsquo;
complains &Agrave; Kempis.&nbsp; And, again, &lsquo;If only every new
year we would root out but one vice.&rsquo;&nbsp; Well, now, what do
you say to that, my true and very brethren?&nbsp; What do you say to
that?&nbsp; Here we are, by God&rsquo;s grace and long-suffering to
usward, near the end of another year, another vicious year; and why
have we been borne with through so many vicious years but that we should
now cease from vice and begin to learn virtue?&nbsp; Why are we here
over Ill-pause this Sabbath night?&nbsp; Why, but that we should shake
off that varlet liar before another new year.&nbsp; That is the whole
reason why we have been spared to see this Sabbath night.&nbsp; God
decreed it for us that we should have this text and this discourse here
to-night, and that is the reason why you and I have been so unaccountably
spared so long.&nbsp; Let us select one vice for the axe then to-night,
and give God in heaven the satisfaction of seeing that His long-suffering
with us has not been wholly in vain.&nbsp; Let us lay the axe at one
vice from this night.&nbsp; And what one from among so many shall it
be?&nbsp; What is the mockery of preaching if a preacher does not practise?&nbsp;
And, accordingly, I have selected one vice out of my thicket for next
year.&nbsp; Will you do the same?&nbsp; The secret of the Lord is with
them that fear Him.&nbsp; Just make your selection and keep it to yourself,
at least till you are able this time next year to say to us&mdash;Come,
all ye that fear God, and I will tell you what He hath done for my soul.&nbsp;
Yes, come on, and from this day all your days on earth, and all the
days of eternity, you will thank God for John Bunyan and his <i>Holy
War</i> and his Ill-pause.&nbsp; Make your selection, then, for your
new axe.&nbsp; Attack some one sin at this so auspicious season.&nbsp;
Swear before God, and unknown to all men&mdash;swear sure death, and
that without any more delay, to that selected sin.&nbsp; Never once,
all your days, do that sin again.&nbsp; Determine never once to do it
again.&nbsp; Determine that by prayer, by secret, and at the same time
outspoken, prayer on your knees.&nbsp; Determine it by faith in the
cleansing blood and renewing spirit of Jesus Christ.&nbsp; Determine
it by fear of instant death, and by sure hope of everlasting life.&nbsp;
Determine it by reasons, and motives, and arguments, and encouragements
known to no-one but yourself, and to be suspected by no human being.&nbsp;
Name the doomed sin.&nbsp; Denounce it.&nbsp; Execrate it.&nbsp; Execute
it.&nbsp; Draw a line across your short and uncertain life, and say
to that besetting and presumptuous sin, Hitherto, and no further!&nbsp;
Do not say you cannot do it.&nbsp; You can if you only will.&nbsp; You
can if you only choose.&nbsp; And smiting down that one sin will loosen
and shake down the whole evil fabric of sin.&nbsp; Breaking but that
one link will break the whole of Satan&rsquo;s snare and evil fetter.&nbsp;
Here is &Agrave; Kempis&rsquo;s forest of vices out of which he hewed
down one every year.&nbsp; Restless lust, outward senses, empty phantoms,
always longing to get, always sparing to give, careless as to talk,
unwilling to sit silent, eager for food, wakeful for news, weary of
a good book, quick to anger, easy of offence at my neighbour, and too
ready to judge him, too merry over prosperity, and too gloomy, fretful,
and peevish in adversity; so often making good rules for my future life,
and coming so little speed with them all, and so on.&nbsp; And, in facing
even such a terrible thicket as that, let not even an old man absolutely
despair.&nbsp; At forty, at sixty, at threescore and ten, let not an
old penitent despair.&nbsp; Only take axe in hand and see if the sun
does not stand still upon Gibeon, and the moon in the valley of Ajalon
till you have avenged yourself on your enemies.&nbsp; And always when
you stop to wipe your brow, and to whet the edge of your axe, and to
wet your lips with water, keep on saying things like those of another
great sinner deep in his thicket of vice, say this: O God, he said,
Thou hast not cut off as a weaver my life, nor from day even to night
hast Thou made an end of me.&nbsp; But Thou hast vouchsafed to me life
and breath even to this hour from childhood, youth, and hitherto even
unto old age.&nbsp; He holdeth our soul in life, and suffereth not our
feet to slide, rescuing me from perils, sicknesses, poverty, bondage,
public shame, evil chances; keeping me from perishing in my sins, and
waiting patiently for my full conversion.&nbsp; Glory be to Thee, O
Lord, glory to Thee, for Thine incomprehensible and unimaginable goodness
toward me of all sinners far and away the most unworthy.&nbsp; The voices
and the concert of voices of angels and men be to Thee; the concert
of all thy saints in heaven and of all Thy creatures in heaven and on
earth; and of me, beneath their feet an unworthy and wretched sinner,
Thy abject creature; my praise also, now, in this day and hour, and
every day till my last breath, and till the end of this world, and then
to all eternity, where they cease not saying, To Him who loved us, Amen!</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XIII&mdash;MR. PENNY-WISE-AND-POUND-FOOLISH, AND MR. GET-I&rsquo;-THE-HUNDRED-AND-LOSE-I&rsquo;-THE-SHIRE</h2>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;For, what shall it profit a man, if he shall gain
the whole world, and lose his own soul?&rsquo;&mdash;<i>Our Lord</i>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This whole world is the penny, and our own souls are the pound.&nbsp;
This whole world is the hundred, while heaven itself is the shire.&nbsp;
And the question this evening is, Are we wise in the penny and foolish
in the pound?&nbsp; And, are we getting in the hundred and losing in
the shire?</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; Well, then, to begin at the beginning, we are already begun
to be penny-wise and pound-foolish with our children when we are so
particular with them about their saying their little prayers night and
morning, while all the time we are so inattentive and so indolent to
explain to them how they are to pray, what they are to pray for, and
how they are to wait and how long they are to wait for the things they
pray for.&nbsp; Then, again, we are penny-wise and pound-foolish with
our children when we train them up into all the proprieties and etiquettes
of family and social life, and at the same time pay so little attention
to their inward life of opening thought and quickening desire and awakening
passion.&nbsp; When we are so eager also for our children to be great
with great people, without much regard to the moral and religious character
of those great people, then again we are like a man who may be wise
for a penny, but is certainly a fool for a pound.&nbsp; When we prefer
the gay and the fashionable world to the intellectual, the religious,
and the philanthropical world for our children, then we lose both the
penny and the pound as well.&nbsp; Almost as much as we do when we accept
the penny of wealth and station and so-called connection for a son or
a daughter, in room of the pound of character, and intelligence, and
personal religion.</p>
<p>Then, again, even in our own religious life we are ourselves often
and notoriously wise in the penny and foolish in the pound.&nbsp; As,
for instance, when we are so scrupulous and so conscientious about forms
and ceremonies, about times and places, and so on.&nbsp; In short, the
whole ritual that has risen up around spiritual religion in all our
churches, from that of the Pope himself out to that of George Fox&mdash;it
is all the penny rather than the pound.&nbsp; This rite and that ceremony;
this habit and that tradition; this ancient and long-established usage,
as well as that new departure and that threatened innovation;&mdash;it
is all, at its best, always the penny and never the pound.&nbsp; Satan
busied me about the lesser matters of religion, says James Fraser of
Brea, and made me neglect the more substantial points.&nbsp; He made
me tithe to God my mint, and my anise and my cummin, and many other
of my herbs, to my all but complete neglect of justice and mercy and
faith and love.&nbsp; Whether there are any of the things that Brea
would call mint and anise and cummin that are taking up too much of
the time of our controversially-minded men in all our churches, highland
and lowland, to-day is a matter for humbling thought.&nbsp; Labour,
my brethren, for yourselves, at any rate, to get yourselves into that
sane and sober habit of mind that instantly and instinctively puts all
mint and all cummin of all kinds into the second place, and all the
weightier matters, both of law and of gospel, into the first place.&nbsp;
I wasted myself on too nice points, laments Brea in his deep, honest,
clear-eyed autobiography.&nbsp; I did not proportion my religious things
aright.&nbsp; The laird of Brea does not say in as many words that he
was wise in the penny and foolish in the pound, but that is exactly
what he means.</p>
<p>Then, again, the narrowness, the partiality, the sickliness, and
the squeamishness of our consciences,&mdash;all that makes us to be
too often penny-wise and pound-foolish in our religious life.&nbsp;
A well-instructed, thoroughly wise, and well-balanced conscience is
an immense blessing to that man who has purchased such a conscience
for himself.&nbsp; There is an immense and a criminal waste of conscience
that goes on among some of our best Christian people through the want
of light and space, room, and breadth, and balance in their consciences.&nbsp;
We are all pestered with people every day who are full of all manner
of childish scrupulosity and sickly squeamishness in their ill-nourished,
ill-exercised consciences.&nbsp; As long as a man&rsquo;s conscience
is ignorant and weak and sickly it will, it must, spend and waste itself
on the pennyworths of religion and&rsquo; morals instead of the pounds.&nbsp;
It will occupy and torture itself with points and punctilios, jots and
tittles, to the all but total oblivion, and to the all but complete
neglect, of the substance and the essence of the Christian mind, the
Christian heart, and the Christian character.&nbsp; The washing of hands,
of cups, and of pots, was all the conscience that multitudes had in
our Lord&rsquo;s day; and multitudes in our day scatter and waste their
consciences on the same things.&nbsp; A good man, an otherwise good
and admirable man, will absolutely ruin and destroy his conscience by
points and scruples and traditions of men as fatally as another will
by a life of debauchery.&nbsp; Some old and decayed ecclesiastical rubric;
some absolutely indifferent form in public worship; some small casuistical
question about a creed or a catechism; some too nice point of confessional
interpretation; the mint and anise and cummin of such matters will fill
and inflame and poison a man&rsquo;s mind and heart and conscience for
months and for years, to the total destruction of all that for which
churches and creeds exist; to the total suspense, if not the total and
lasting destruction, of sobriety of mind, balance and breadth of judgment,
humility, charity, and a hidden and a holy life.&nbsp; The penny of
a perverted, partial, and fanaticised conscience has swallowed up the
pound of instruction, and truth, and justice, and brotherly love.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; &lsquo;Nor is the man with the long name at all inferior
to the other,&rsquo; said Lucifer, in laying his infernal plot against
the peace and prosperity of Mansoul.&nbsp; Now, the man with the long
name was just Mr. Get-i&rsquo;-the-hundred-and-lose-i&rsquo;-the-shire.&nbsp;
A hundred in the old county geography of England was a political subdivision
of a shire, in which five score freemen lived with their freeborn families.&nbsp;
A county or a shire was described and enumerated by the poll-sheriff
of that day as containing so many enfranchised hundreds; and the total
number of hundreds made up the political unity of the shire.&nbsp; To
this day we still hear from time to time of the &lsquo;Chiltern Hundreds,&rsquo;
which is a division of Buckinghamshire that belongs, along with its
political franchise, to the Crown, and which is utilised for Crown purposes
at certain political emergencies.&nbsp; This proverb, then, to get i&rsquo;
the hundred and lose i&rsquo; the shire, is now quite plain to us.&nbsp;
You might canvass so as to get a hundred, several hundreds, many hundreds
on your side, and yet you might lose when it came to counting up the
whole shire.&nbsp; You might possess yourself of a hundred or two and
yet be poor compared with him who possessed the whole shire.&nbsp; And
then the proverb has been preserved out of the old political life of
England, and has been moralised and spiritualised to us in the <i>Holy
War</i>.&nbsp; And thus after to-night we shall always call this shrewd
proverb to mind when we are tempted to take a part at the risk of the
whole; to receive this world at the loss of the next world; or, as our
Lord has it, to gain the whole world and to lose our own soul.&nbsp;
Lot&rsquo;s choice of Sodom and Gomorrah, and Esau&rsquo;s purchase
of the mess of pottage in the Old Testament; and then Judas&rsquo;s
thirty pieces of silver, and Ananias and Sapphira&rsquo;s part of the
price in the New Testament, are all so many well-known instances of
getting in the hundred and losing in the shire.&nbsp; And not Esau&rsquo;s
and Lot&rsquo;s only, but our own lives also have been full up to to-day
of the same fatal transaction.&nbsp; This house, as our Lord again has
it, this farm, this merchandise, this shop, this office, this salary,
this honour, this home&mdash;all this on the one hand, and then our
Lord Himself, His call, His cause, His Church, with everlasting life
in the other&mdash;when it is set down before us in black and white
in that way, the transaction, the proposal, the choice is preposterous,
is insane, is absolutely impossible.&nbsp; But preposterous, insane,
absolutely impossible, and all, there it is, in our own lives, in the
lives of our sons and daughters, and in the lives of multitudes of other
men and other men&rsquo;s sons and daughters besides ours.&nbsp; Every
day you will be taken in, and you will stand by and see other men taken
in with the present penny for the future pound: and with the poor pelting
hundred under your eye for the full, far-extending, and ever-enriching
shire.&nbsp; Lucifer is always abroad pressing on us in his malice the
penny on the spot, for the pound which he keeps out of sight; he dazzles
our eyes with the gain of the hundred till we gnash our teeth at the
loss of the shire.</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;He hath in sooth good cause for endless grief,<br />
Who, for the love of thing that lasteth not,<br />
Despoils himself for ever of THAT LOVE.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>3.&nbsp; &lsquo;What also if we join with those two another two of
ours, Mr. Sweet-world and Mr. Present-good, namely, for they are two
men full of civility and cunning.&nbsp; Let these engage in this business
for us, and let Mansoul be taken up with much business, and if possible
with much pleasure, and this is the way to get ground of them.&nbsp;
Let us but cumber and occupy and amuse Mansoul sufficiently, and they
will make their castle a warehouse for goods instead of a garrison for
men of war.&rsquo;&nbsp; This diabolical advice was highly applauded
all through hell till all the lesser devils, while setting themselves
to carry it out, gnashed their teeth with envy and malice at Lucifer
for having thought of this masterpiece and for having had it received
with such loud acclamation.&nbsp; &lsquo;Only get them,&rsquo; so went
on that so able, so well-envied, and so well-hated devil, &lsquo;let
us only get those fribble sinners for a night at a time to forget their
misery.&nbsp; And it will not cost us much to do that.&nbsp; Only let
us offer them in one another&rsquo;s houses a supper, a dance, a pipe,
a newspaper full of their own shame, a tale full of their own folly,
a silly song, and He who loved them with an everlasting love will soon
see of the travail of His soul in them!&rsquo;&nbsp; Yes, my fellow-sinners,
Lucifer and his infernal crew know us and despise us and entrap us at
very little trouble, till He who travailed for us on the tree covers
His face in heaven and weeps over us.&nbsp; As long as we remember our
misery, all the mind, and all the malice, and all the sleeplessness
in hell cannot touch a hair of our head.&nbsp; But when by any emissary
and opportunity either from earth around us or from hell beneath us
we for another night forget our misery, it is all over with us.&nbsp;
And yet, to tell the truth, we never can quite forget our misery.&nbsp;
We are too miserable ever to forget our misery.&nbsp; In the full steam
of Lucifer&rsquo;s best-spread supper, amid the shouts of laughter and
the clapping of hands, and all the outward appearance of a complete
forgetfulness of our misery, yet it is not so.&nbsp; It is far from
being so.&nbsp; Our misery is far too deep-seated for all the devil&rsquo;s
drugs.&nbsp; Only, to give Lucifer his due, we do sometimes, under him,
so get out of touch with the true consolation for our misery that, night
after night, through cumber, through pursuit of pleasure, through the
time being taken up with these and other like things, we do so far forget
our misery as to lie down without dealing with it; but only to have
it awaken us, and take our arm as its own for another miserable day.&nbsp;
Yes; though never completely successful, yet this masterpiece of hell
is sufficiently successful for Satan&rsquo;s subtlest purposes; which
are, not to make us forget our misery, but to make us put it away from
us at the natural and proper hour for facing it and for dealing with
it in the only proper and successful way.&nbsp; But, wholly, any night,
or even partially for a few nights at a time, to forget our misery&mdash;no,
with all thy subtlety of intellect and with all thy hell-filled heart,
O Lucifer, that is to us impossible!&nbsp; Forget our misery!&nbsp;
O devil of devils, no!&nbsp; Bless God, that can never be with us!&nbsp;
Our misery is too deep, too dreadful, too acute, too all-consuming ever
to be forgotten by us even for an hour.&nbsp; Our misery is too terrible
for thee, with all thy overthrown intellect and all thy malice-filled
heart, ever to understand!&nbsp; Didst thou for one midnight hour taste
it, and so understand it, then there would be the same hope for thee
that, I bless God, there still is for me!</p>
<p>Let us bend all our strength and all our wit to this, went on Lucifer,
to make their castle a warehouse instead of a garrison.&nbsp; Let us
set ourselves and all our allies, he explained to the duller-witted
among the devils, to make their hearts a shop,&mdash;some of them, you
know, are shopkeepers; a bank,&mdash;some of them are bankers; a farm,&mdash;some
of them are farmers; a study,&mdash;some of them are students; a pulpit,&mdash;some
of them like to preach; a table,&mdash;some of them are gluttons; a
drawing-room,&mdash;some of them are busybodies who forget their own
misery in retailing other people&rsquo;s misery from house to house.&nbsp;
Be wise as serpents, said the old serpent; attend, each several fallen
angel of you, to his own special charge.&nbsp; Study your man.&nbsp;
Get to the bottom of your man.&nbsp; Follow him about; never let him
out of your sight; be sure before you begin, be sure you have the joint
in his harness, the spot in his heel, the chink in his wall full in
your eye.&nbsp; I do not surely need to tell you not to scatter our
snares for souls at random, he went on.&nbsp; Give the minister his
study Bible, the student his classic, the merchant his ledger, the glutton
his well-dressed dish and his elect year of wine, the gossip her sweet
secret, and the flirt her fool.&nbsp; Study them till they are all naked
and open to your sharp eyes.&nbsp; Find out what best makes them forget
even for one night their misery and ply them with that.&nbsp; If I ever
see that soul I have set thee over on his knees on account of his misery
I shall fling thee on the spot into the bottomless pit.&nbsp; And if
any of you shall anywhere discover a man&mdash;and there are such men&mdash;a
man who forgets his misery through always thinking and speaking about
it, only keep him in his pulpit, and off his knees, and no man so safe
for hell as he.&nbsp; There are fools, and there are double-dyed fools,
and that man is the chief of them.&nbsp; Give him his fill of sin and
misery; let him luxuriate himself in sin and misery; only, keep him
there, and I will not forget thy most excellent service to me.</p>
<p>Make all their hearts, so Lucifer summed up, as he dismissed his
obsequious devils, make all their several hearts each a warehouse, a
shop, a farm, a pulpit, a library, a nursery, a supper-table, a chamber
of wantonness&mdash;let it be to each man just after his own heart.&nbsp;
Only, keep&mdash;as you shall answer for it,&mdash;keep faith and hope
and charity and innocence and patience and especially prayerfulness
out of their hearts.&nbsp; And when this my counsel is fulfilled, and
when the pit closes over thy charge, I shall pay thee thy wages, and
promote thee to honour.&nbsp; And before he was well done they were
all at their posts.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XIV&mdash;THE DEVIL&rsquo;S LAST CARD</h2>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Satan himself is transformed into an angel of
light&rsquo;&mdash;<i>Paul</i>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Wodrow has an anecdote in his delightful <i>Analecta</i> which shall
introduce us into our subject to-night.&nbsp; Mr. John Menzies was a
very pious and devoted pastor; he was a learned man also, and well seen
in the Popish and in the Arminian controversies.&nbsp; And to the end
of his life he was much esteemed of the people of Aberdeen as a foremost
preacher of the gospel.&nbsp; And yet, &lsquo;Oh to have one more Sabbath
in my pulpit!&rsquo; he cried out on his death-bed.&nbsp; &lsquo;What
would you then do?&rsquo; asked some one who sat at his bedside.&nbsp;
&lsquo;I would preach to my people on the tremendous difficulty of salvation!&rsquo;
exclaimed the dying man.</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; Now, the first difficulty that stands in the way of our
salvation is the stupendous mass of guilt that has accumulated upon
all of us.&nbsp; Our guilt is so great that we dare not think of it.&nbsp;
It is too horrible to believe that we shall ever be called to account
for one in a thousand of it.&nbsp; It crushes our minds with a perfect
stupor of horror, when for a moment we try to imagine a day of judgment
when we shall be judged for all the deeds that we have done in the body.&nbsp;
Heart-beat after heart-beat, breath after breath, hour after hour, day
after day, year after year, and all full of sin; all nothing but sin
from our mother&rsquo;s womb to our grave.&nbsp; Sometimes one outstanding
act of sin has quite overwhelmed us.&nbsp; But before long that awful
sin fell out of sight and out of mind.&nbsp; Other sins of the same
kind succeeded it.&nbsp; Our sense of sin, our sense of guilt was soon
extinguished by a life of sin, till, at the present moment the accumulated
and tremendous load of our sin and guilt is no more felt by us than
we feel the tremendous load of the atmosphere.&nbsp; But, all the time,
does not our great guilt lie sealed down upon us?&nbsp; Because we are
too seared and too stupefied to feel it, is it therefore not there?&nbsp;
Because we never think of it, does that prove that both God and man
have forgiven and forgotten it?&nbsp; Shall the Judge of all the earth
do right in the matter of all men&rsquo;s guilt but ours?&nbsp; Does
the apostle&rsquo;s warning not hold in our case?&mdash;his awful warning
that we shall all stand before the judgment-seat?&nbsp; And is it only
a strong figure of speech that the books shall be opened till we shall
cry to the mountains to fall on us and to the rocks to cover us?&nbsp;
Oh no! the truth is, the half has not been told us of the speechless
stupefaction that shall fall on us when the trumpet shall sound and
when Alp upon Alp of aggravated guilt shall rise up high as heaven between
us and our salvation.&nbsp; Difficulty is not the name for guilt like
ours.&nbsp; Impossibility is the better name we should always know it
by.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; Another difficulty or impossibility to our salvation rises
out of the awful corruption and pollution of our hearts.&nbsp; But is
there any use entering on that subject?&nbsp; Is there one man in a
hundred who even knows the rudiments of the language I must now speak
in?&nbsp; Is there one man in a hundred in whose mind any idea arises,
and in whose heart any emotion or passion is kindled, as I proceed to
speak of corruption of nature and pollution of heart?&nbsp; I do not
suppose it.&nbsp; I do not presume upon it.&nbsp; I do not believe it.&nbsp;
That most miserable man who is let down of God&rsquo;s Holy Spirit into
the pit of corruption that is in his own heart,&mdash;to him his corruption,
added to his guilt, causes a sadness that nothing in this world can
really relieve; it causes a deep and an increasing melancholy, such
as the ninety and nine who need no repentance and feel no pollution
know nothing of.&nbsp; All living men flee from the corruption of an
unburied corpse.&nbsp; The living at once set about to bury their dead.&nbsp;
&lsquo;I am a stranger and a sojourner among you,&rsquo; said Abraham
to the children of Heth; &lsquo;give me a possession of a burying-place
among you that I may bury my dead out of my sight.&rsquo;&nbsp; But
Paul could find no grave in the whole world in which to bury out of
his sight the body of death to which he was chained fast; that body
of sin and death which always makes the holiest of men the most wretched
of men,&mdash;till the loathing and the disgust and the misery that
filled the apostle&rsquo;s heart are to be understood by but one in
a thousand even of the people of God.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; And then, as if to make our salvation a very hyperbole of
impossibility, the all but almighty power of indwelling sin comes in.&nbsp;
Have you ever tried to break loose from the old fetter of an evil habit?&nbsp;
Have you ever said on a New Year&rsquo;s Day with Thomas &Agrave; Kempis
that this year you would root that appetite,&mdash;naming it,&mdash;out
of your body, and that vice,&mdash;naming it,&mdash;out of your heart?&nbsp;
Have you ever sworn at the Communion table that you would watch and
pray, and set a watch on your evil heart against that envy, and that
revenge, and that ill-will, and that distaste, dislike, and antipathy?&nbsp;
Then your minister will not need to come back from his death-bed to
preach to you on the difficulty of salvation.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; And yet such is the grace of God, such is the work of Christ,
and such is the power and the patience of the Holy Ghost that, if we
had only an adequate ministry in our pulpits, and an assisting literature
in our homes, even this three-fold impossibility would be overcome and
we would be saved.&nbsp; But if the ministry that is set over us is
an ignorant, indolent, incompetent, self-deceived ministry; if our own
chosen, set-up, and maintained minister is himself an uninstructed,
unspiritual, unsanctified man; and if the books we buy and borrow and
read are all secular, unspiritual, superficial, ephemeral, silly, stupid,
impertinent books, then the impossibility of our salvation is absolute,
and we are as good as in hell already with all our guilt and all our
corruption for ever on our heads.&nbsp; Now, that was the exact case
of Mansoul in the allegory of the Holy War at one of the last and acutest
stages of that war.&nbsp; Or, rather, that would have been her exact
case had Diabolus got his own deep, diabolical way with her.&nbsp; For
what did her ancient enemy do but sound a parley till he had played
his last card in these glozing and deceitful words;&mdash;&lsquo;I myself,&rsquo;
he had the face to say to Emmanuel, &lsquo;if Thou wilt raise Thy siege
and leave the town to me, I will, at my own proper cost and charge,
set up and maintain a sufficient ministry, besides lecturers, in Mansoul,
who shall show to Mansoul that transgression stands in the way of life;
the ministers I shall set up shall also press the necessity of reformation
according to Thy holy law.&rsquo;&nbsp; And even now, with the two pulpits,
God&rsquo;s and the devil&rsquo;s, and the two preachers, and the two
pastors, in our own city,&mdash;how many of you see any difference,
or think that the one is any worse or any better than the other?&nbsp;
Or, indeed, that the ministry of the last card is not the better of
the two to your interest and to your taste, to the state of your mind
and to the need of your heart?&nbsp; Let us proceed, then, to look at
Mansoul&rsquo;s two pulpits and her two lectureships as they stand portrayed
on the devil&rsquo;s last card and in Emmanuel&rsquo;s crowning commission;
that is, if our eyes are sharp enough to see any difference.</p>
<p>5.&nbsp; The first thing, then, on the devil&rsquo;s last card was
this, &lsquo;A sufficient ministry, besides lecturers, in Mansoul.&rsquo;&nbsp;
Now, a sufficient ministry has never been seen in the true Church of
Christ since her ministry began.&nbsp; And yet she has had great ministers
in her time.&nbsp; After Christ Himself, Paul was the greatest and the
best minister the Church of Christ has ever had.&nbsp; But such was
the transcendent greatness of his office, such were its tremendous responsibilities,
such were its magnificent opportunities and its incessant demands, such
were its ceaseless calls to consecration, to cross-bearing, to crucifixion,
to more and more inwardness of holiness, and to higher and higher heights
of heavenly-mindedness, that the apostle was fain to cry out continually,
Who is sufficient for these things!&nbsp; But so well did Paul learn
that gospel which he preached to others that amid all his insufficiency
he was able to hear his Master saying to him every day, My grace is
sufficient for thee, and, My strength is made perfect in thy weakness!&nbsp;
And to come down to the truly Pauline succession of ministers in our
own lands and in our own churches, what preachers and what pastors Christ
gave to Kidderminster, and to Bedford, and to Down and Connor, and to
Sodor and Man, and to Anwoth, and to Ettrick, and to New England, and
to St. Andrews, and places too many to mention.&nbsp; With all its infirmity
and all its inefficiency, what a truly heavenly power the pulpit is
when it is filled by a man of God who gives his whole mind and heart,
his whole time and thought to it, and to the pastorate that lies around
it.&nbsp; His mind may be small, and his heart may be full of corruption;
his time may be full of manifold interruptions, and his best study may
yield but a poor result; but if Heaven ever helps those who honestly
help themselves, then that is certainly the case in the Christian ministry.&nbsp;
Let the choicest of our children, then, be sought out and consecrated
to that service; let our most gifted and most gracious-minded sons be
sent to where they shall be best prepared for the pulpit and the pastorate,&mdash;till
by the blessing of her Head all the congregations and all the parishes,
all the pulpits and all the lectureships in the Church, shall be one
garden of the Lord.&nbsp; And then we shall escape that last curse of
a ministry such as John Bunyan saw all around him in the England of
his day, and which, had he been alive in the England and Scotland of
our day, he would have painted again in colours we have neither the
boldness nor the skill to mix nor to put on the canvas.&nbsp; But let
all ministers put it every day to themselves to what descent and succession
they belong.&nbsp; Let those even who believe that they have within
themselves the best seal and evidence attainable here that they have
been ordained of Emmanuel, let them all the more look well every day
and every Sabbath day how much of another master&rsquo;s doctrine and
discipline, motives, and manners still mixes up with their best ministry.&nbsp;
And the surest seal that, with all our insufficiency, we are still the
ministers of Christ will be set on us by this, that the harder we work
and the more in secret we pray, the more and ever the more shall we
discover and confess our shameful insufficiency, and the more shall
we, till the day of our death, every day still begin our ministry of
labour and of prayer anew.&nbsp; Let us do that, for the devil, with
all his boldness and all his subtilty, never threw a card first or last
like that.</p>
<p>6.&nbsp; After offering a sufficient ministry to Mansoul, and that,
too, at his own proper cost and charge, Diabolus undertook also to see
that the absolute necessity of a reformation should be preached and
pressed from the pulpit he set up.&nbsp; Now, reformation is all good
and necessary, in its own time and place and order, but God sent His
Son not to be a Reformer but to be a Redeemer.&nbsp; John came to preach
reformation, but Jesus came to preach regeneration.&nbsp; Except a man
be born again, Jesus persistently preached to Nicodemus.&nbsp; &lsquo;Did
it begin with regeneration?&rsquo; was Dr. Duncan&rsquo;s reply when
a sermon on sanctification was praised in his hearing.&nbsp; And like
so much else that the learned and profound Dr. John Duncan said on theology
and philosophy, that question went at once to the root of the matter.&nbsp;
For sanctification, that is to say, salvation, is no mere reformation
of morals or refinement of manners.&nbsp; It is a maxim in sound morals
that the morality of the man must precede the morality of his actions.&nbsp;
And much more is it the evangelical law of Jesus Christ.&nbsp; Make
the tree good, our Lawgiver aphoristically said.&nbsp; Reformation and
sanctification differ, says Dr. Hodge, as clean clothes differ from
a clean heart.&nbsp; Now, Diabolus was all for clean clothes when he
saw that Mansoul was slipping out of his hands.&nbsp; He would have
all the drunkards to become moderate drinkers, if not total abstainers;
and all the sensualists to become, if need be, ascetics; and all those
who had sowed out their wild oats to settle down as heads of houses,
and members, if not ministers and elders, in his set-up church.&nbsp;
But we are too well taught, surely; we have gone too long to another
church than that which Diabolus ever sets up, to be satisfied with his
superficial doctrine and his skin-deep discipline.&nbsp; We know, do
we not, that we may do all that his last card asks us to do, and yet
be as far, ay, and far farther from salvation than the heathen are who
never heard the name.&nbsp; A hundred Scriptures tell us that; and our
hearts know too much of their own plague and corruption ever now to
be satisfied short of a full regeneration and a complete sanctification.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Create in me a clean heart and renew a right spirit within me.&nbsp;
The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit.&nbsp; And the very God of
peace sanctify you wholly.&nbsp; And I pray God your whole spirit and
soul and body be preserved blameless unto the coming of our Lord Jesus
Christ.&rsquo;&nbsp; The last card has many Scriptures cunningly copied
upon it; but not these.&nbsp; Its pulpit orators handle many Scripture
texts, but never these.</p>
<p>7.&nbsp; Yes, the devil comes in even here with that so late, so
subtle, and so contradicting card of his.&nbsp; Where is it in this
world that he does not come in with some of his cards?&nbsp; And he
comes in here as a very angel of evangelical light.&nbsp; He puts on
the gown of Geneva here, and he ascends Emmanuel&rsquo;s own maintained
pulpit here, and from that pulpit he preaches, and where he so preaches
he preaches nothing else but the very highest articles of the Reformed
faith.&nbsp; Carnal-security was strong on assurance, no other man in
Mansoul was so strong; and the devil will let us preachers be as strong
and as often on election, and justification, and indefectible grace,
and the perseverance of the saints as we and our people like, if we
but keep in season and out of season on these transcendent subjects
and keep off morals and manners, walk and conversation, conduct and
character.&nbsp; In Hooker&rsquo;s and Travers&rsquo; day, Thomas Fuller
tells us, the Temple pulpit preached pure Canterbury in the morning
and pure Geneva in the afternoon.&nbsp; And you will get the highest
Calvinism off the last card in one pulpit, and the strictest and most
urgent morality off the same card in another; but never, if the devil
can help it, never both in one and the same pulpit; never both in one
and the same sermon; and never both in one and the same minister.&nbsp;
You have all heard of the difficulty the voyager had in steering between
Scylla and Charybdis in the Latin adage.&nbsp; Well, the true preacher&rsquo;s
difficulty is just like that.&nbsp; Indeed, it is beyond the wit of
man, and it takes all the wit of God, aright to unite the doctrine of
our utter inability with the companion doctrine of our strict responsibility;
free grace with a full reward; the cross of Christ once for all, with
the saint&rsquo;s continual crucifixion; the Saviour&rsquo;s blood with
the sinner&rsquo;s; and atonement with attainment; in short, salvation
without works with no salvation without works.&nbsp; Deft steersman
as the devil is, he never yet took his ship clear through those Charybdic
passages.</p>
<p>One thing there is that I must have preached continually in all my
pulpits and expounded and illustrated and enforced in all my lectureships,
said Emmanuel, and that is, my new example and my new law of <i>motive</i>.&nbsp;
My own motives always made me in all I said and did to be well-pleasing
in My Father&rsquo;s eyes, and at any cost I must have preachers and
lecturers set up in Mansoul who shall assist Me in making Mansoul as
well-pleasing in My Father&rsquo;s sight as I was Myself.</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;For I am ware it is the seed of act<br />
God holds appraising in His hollow palm,<br />
Not act grown great thence as the world believes,<br />
Leafage and branchage vulgar eyes admire.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Motives! gnashed Diabolus.&nbsp; And he tore his last card into a
thousand shreds and cast the shreds under his feet in his rage and exasperation.&nbsp;
Motives!&nbsp; New motives!&nbsp; Truly Thou art the threatened Seed
of the woman!&nbsp; Truly Thou art the threatened Son of God!&mdash;Let
all our preachers, then, preach much on motive to their people.&nbsp;
The commonplace crowd of their people will not all like that preaching
any more than Diabolus did; but their best people will all afterwards
rise up in their salvation and bless them for it.&nbsp; On reformation
also, let them every Sabbath preach, but only on the reformation that
rises out of a reformed motive, and that again out of a reformed heart.&nbsp;
And if a reformed motive, a reformed heart, and a reformed life are
found both by preacher and hearer to be impossible; if all that only
brings out the hopelessness of their salvation by reason of the guilt
and the pollution and power of sin; then all that will only be to them
that same ever deeper entering of the law into their hearts which led
Paul to an ever deeper faith and trust in Jesus Christ.&nbsp; With a
guilt, and a pollution, and a slavery to sin like ours, salvation from
sin would be absolutely impossible.&nbsp; Absolutely impossible, that
is, but for our Saviour, Jesus Christ.&nbsp; But with His atoning blood
and His Holy Spirit all things are possible&mdash;even our salvation.</p>
<p>Let us choose, then, a minister like Mr. John Menzies.&nbsp; Let
us read the great books that make salvation difficult.&nbsp; Let us
work out our own salvation, day and night, with fear and trembling,
and when Wisdom is justified in her children, we shall be found justified
among them.&nbsp; We shall be openly acknowledged and acquitted in the
day of judgment, and made perfectly blessed in the full enjoying of
God to all eternity.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XV&mdash;MR. PRYWELL</h2>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Search me, O God, and know my heart.&rsquo;&mdash;<i>David</i>.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Let a man examine himself.&rsquo;&mdash;<i>Paul</i>.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Look to yourselves.&rsquo;&mdash;<i>John</i>.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Know thyself.&rsquo;&mdash;<i>Apollo</i>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The year 1668 saw the publication of one of the deepest books in
the whole world, Dr. John Owen&rsquo;s <i>Remainders of Indwelling Sin
in Believers</i>.&nbsp; The heart-searching depth; the clear, fearless,
humbling truth, the intense spirituality, and the massive and masculine
strength of John Owen&rsquo;s book have all combined to make it one
of the acknowledged masterpieces of the great Puritan school.&nbsp;
Had John Owen&rsquo;s style been at all equal to his great learning,
to the depth and the grasp of his mind, and to the lofty holiness of
his life, John Owen would have stood in the very foremost and selectest
rank of apostolical and evangelical theologians.&nbsp; But in all his
books Owen labours under the fatal drawback of a bad style.&nbsp; A
fine style, a style like that of Hooker, or Taylor, or Bunyan, or Howe,
or Leighton, or Law, is such a winning introduction to their works and
such an abiding charm and spell.&nbsp; The full title of Dr. Owen&rsquo;s
great work runs thus: <i>The Nature, Power, Deceit, and Prevalency of
the Remainders of Indwelling Sin in Believers</i>&mdash;a title that
will tell all true students what awaits them when they have courage
and enterprise enough to address themselves to this supreme and all-essential
subject.&nbsp; Fourteen years after the publication of Dr. Owen&rsquo;s
epoch-making book, John Bunyan&rsquo;s <i>Holy War</i> first saw the
light.&nbsp; Equal in scriptural and in experimental depth, as also
in their spiritual loftiness and intensity, those two books are as different
as any two books, written in the same language, and written on the same
subject, could by any possibility be.&nbsp; John Owen&rsquo;s book is
the book of a great scholar who has read the Fathers and the Schoolmen
and the Reformers till he knows them by heart, and till he has been
able to digest all that is true to Scripture and to experience in them
into his rich and ripe book.&nbsp; A powerful reasoner, a severe, bald,
muscular writer, John Owen in all these respects stands at the very
opposite pole to that of John Bunyan.&nbsp; The author of the <i>Holy
War</i> had no learning, but he had a mind of immense natural sagacity,
combined with a habit of close and deep observation of human life, and
especially of religious life, and he had now a lifetime of most fruitful
experience as a Christian man and as a Christian minister behind him;
and, all that, taken up into Bunyan&rsquo;s splendid imagination, enabled
him to produce this extraordinarily able and impressive book.&nbsp;
A model of English style as the <i>Holy War</i> is, at the same time
it does not attain at all to the rank of the <i>Pilgrim&rsquo;s Progress</i>;
but then, to be second to the <i>Pilgrim&rsquo;s Progress</i> is reward
and honour enough for any book.&nbsp; Let all genuine students, then,
who would know the best that has been written on experimental religion,
and who would preach to the deepest and divinest experience of their
best people, let them keep continually within their reach John Owen&rsquo;s
<i>Temptation</i>, his <i>Mortification of Sin in Believers</i>, his
<i>Nature and Power of Indwelling Sin</i>, and John Bunyan&rsquo;s <i>Holy
War made for the Regaining of the Metropolis of this World</i>.</p>
<p>Well, then, as He who dwells on high would have it, there was one
whose name was Mr. Prywell, a great lover of Mansoul.&nbsp; And he,
as his manner was, did go listening up and down in Mansoul to see and
hear, if at any time he might, whether there was any design against
it or no.&nbsp; For he was always a jealous man, and feared some mischief
would befall it, either from within or from some power without.&nbsp;
Mr. Prywell was always a lover of Mansoul, a sober and a judicious man,
a man that was no tattler, nor a raiser of false reports, but one that
loves to look into the very bottom of matters, and talks nothing of
news but by very solid arguments.&nbsp; And then, after our historian
has told us some of the eminent services that Mr. Prywell was able to
perform both for the King and for the city, he goes on to tell us how
the captains determined that public thanks should be given by the town
of Mansoul to Mr. Prywell for his so diligent seeking of the welfare
of the town; and, further, that, forasmuch as he was so naturally inclined
to seek their good, and also to undermine their foes, they gave him
the commission of Scoutmaster-general for the good of Mansoul.&nbsp;
And Mr. Prywell managed his charge and the trust that Mansoul had put
into his hands with great conscience and good fidelity; for he gave
himself wholly up to his employ, and that not only within the town,
but he also went outside of the town to pry, to see, and to hear.&nbsp;
Now, that being so, it may interest and perhaps instruct you to-night
to look for a little at some of the features and at some of the feats
of the Scoutmaster-general of the Holy War, Mr. Prywell, of the town
of Mansoul.</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; &lsquo;Well, now, as He who dwells on high would have it,
there was one whose name was Mr. Prywell, a great lover of the town
of Mansoul.&rsquo;&nbsp; In other words: self-observation, self-examination,
strict, jealous, sleepless self-examination, is of God.&nbsp; Our God
who searches our hearts and tries our reins would have it so.&nbsp;
And if He does not have it so in us, our souls are not as our God would
have them to be.&nbsp; &lsquo;Bunyan employs <i>pry</i>,&rsquo; says
Miss Peacock in her excellent notes, &lsquo;in a more favourable sense
than it now bears.&nbsp; As, for instance, it is said in another part
of this same book that the men of Mansoul were allowed to <i>pry</i>
into the words of the Holy Ghost and to expound them to their best advantage.&nbsp;
Honest anxiety for the welfare of his fellow-townsmen was Mr. Prywell&rsquo;s
chief characteristic.&nbsp; <i>Pry</i> is another form of <i>peer</i>&mdash;to
look narrowly, to look closely.&rsquo;&nbsp; And God, says John Bunyan,
would have it so.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; &lsquo;A great lover of Mansoul,&rsquo; &lsquo;always a
lover of Mansoul&rsquo;; again and again that is testified concerning
Mr. Prywell.&nbsp; It was not love for the work that led Mr. Prywell
to give up his days and his nights as his history tells us he did.&nbsp;
Mr. Prywell ran himself into many dangerous situations both within and
without the city, and he lost himself far more friends than he made
by his devotion to his thankless task.&nbsp; But necessity was laid
upon him.&nbsp; And what held him up was the sure and certain knowledge
that his King would have that service at his hands.&nbsp; That, and
his love for the city, for the safety and the deliverance of the city,&mdash;all
that kept Mr. Prywell&rsquo;s heart fixed.&nbsp; Am I therefore your
enemy? he would say to some who would have had it otherwise than the
King would have it.&nbsp; But it is a good thing to be zealously affected
in a work like mine, he would say, in self-defence and in self-encouragement.&nbsp;
And then, though not many, there were always some in the city who said,
Let him smite me and it shall be a kindness; let him reprove me and
it shall be an excellent oil which shall not break my head.&nbsp; It
was in Mansoul with Mr. Prywell as it was in Kidderminster with Richard
Baxter, when some of his people said to one another, &lsquo;We will
take all things well from one that we know doth entirely love us.&rsquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&lsquo;Love them,&rsquo; said Augustine, &lsquo;and then say anything
you like to them.&rsquo;&nbsp; Now, that was Mr. Prywell&rsquo;s way.&nbsp;
He loved Mansoul, and then he said many things to her that a false lover
and a flatterer would never have dared to say.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; Then, as the saying is, it goes without saying that &lsquo;Mr.
Prywell was always a jealous man.&rsquo;&nbsp; Great lovers are always
jealous men, and Mr. Prywell showed himself to be a great lover by the
great heat of his jealousy also.&nbsp; &lsquo;Vigilant,&rsquo; says
the excellent editress again; &lsquo;cautious against dishonour, reasonably
mistrustful&mdash;low Latin <i>zelosus</i>, full of zeal.&nbsp; &ldquo;And
he said, I have been very jealous for the Lord God of hosts.&rdquo;&rsquo;&nbsp;
Now, it so happened that some of Mr. Prywell&rsquo;s most private and
not at all professional papers&mdash;papers evidently, and on the face
of them, connected with the state of the spy&rsquo;s own soul&mdash;came
into my hands as good lot would have it just the other night.&nbsp;
The moth-eaten chest was full of his old papers, but the pieces that
took my heart most were, as it looked to me, actually gnashed through
with his remorseful teeth, and soaked and sodden past recognition with
his sweat and his tears and his agonising hands.&nbsp; But after some
late hours over those remnants I managed to make some sense to myself
out of them.&nbsp; There are some parts of the parchments that pass
me; but, if only to show you that this arch-spy&rsquo;s so vigilant
jealousy was not all directed against other people&rsquo;s bad hearts
and bad habits, I shall copy some lines out of the old box.&nbsp; &lsquo;Have
I penitence?&rsquo; he begins without any preface.&nbsp; &lsquo;Have
I grief, shame, pain, horror, weariness for my sin?&nbsp; Do I pray
and repent, if not seven times a day as David did, yet at least three
times, as Daniel?&nbsp; If not as Solomon, at length, yet shortly as
the publican?&nbsp; If not like Christ, the whole night, at least for
one hour?&nbsp; If not on the ground and in ashes, at least not in my
bed?&nbsp; If not in sackcloth, at least not in purple and fine linen?&nbsp;
If not altogether freed from all, at least from immoderate desires?&nbsp;
Do I give, if not as Zaccheus did, fourfold, as the law commands, with
the fifth part added?&nbsp; If not as the rich, yet as the widow?&nbsp;
If not the half, yet the thirtieth part?&nbsp; If not above my power,
yet up to my power?&rsquo;&nbsp; And then over the page there are some
illegible pencillings from old authors of his such as this from Augustine:
&lsquo;A good man would rather know his own infirmity than the foundations
of the earth or the heights of the heavens.&rsquo;&nbsp; And this from
Cicero: &lsquo;There are many hiding-places and recesses in the mind.&rsquo;&nbsp;
And this from Seneca: &lsquo;You must know yourself before you can amend
yourself.&nbsp; An unknown sin grows worse and worse and is deprived
of cure.&rsquo;&nbsp; And this from Cicero again: &lsquo;Cato exacted
from himself an account of every day&rsquo;s business at night&rsquo;;
and also Pythagoras,</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Nor let sweet sleep upon thine eyes descend<br />
Till thou hast judged its deeds at each day&rsquo;s end.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And this from Seneca again: &lsquo;When the light is removed out
of sight, and my wife, who is by this time aware of my practice, is
now silent, I pass the whole of my day under examination, and I review
my deeds and my words.&nbsp; I hide nothing from myself: I pass over
nothing.&rsquo;&nbsp; And then in Mr. Prywell&rsquo;s boldest and least
trembling hand: &lsquo;O yes! many shall come from the east and the
west and shall sit down with Abraham and Isaac and Jacob in the kingdom
of heaven, when many of the children of the kingdom shall be cast out.&nbsp;
O yes.&rsquo;&nbsp; Now, this &lsquo;O yes!&rsquo; Miss Peacock tells
us, is the Anglicised form of a French word for our Lord&rsquo;s words,
Take heed how ye hear!</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; &lsquo;A sober and a judicious man&rsquo; it is said of
Mr. Prywell also.&nbsp; To a certainty that.&nbsp; It could not be otherwise
than that.&nbsp; For Mr. Prywell&rsquo;s office, its discoveries and
its experiences, would sober any man.&nbsp; &lsquo;I am sprung from
a country,&rsquo; says Abelard, &lsquo;of which the soil is light, and
the temper of the inhabitants is light.&rsquo;&nbsp; So was it with
Mr. Prywell to begin with.&nbsp; But even Abelard was sobered in time,
and so was Mr. Prywell.&nbsp; Life sobered Abelard, and Mr. Prywell
too; life&rsquo;s crooks and life&rsquo;s crosses, life&rsquo;s duties
and life&rsquo;s disappointments, especially Mr. Prywell.&nbsp; &lsquo;The
more narrowly a man looks into himself,&rsquo; says &Agrave; Kempis,
&lsquo;the more he sorroweth.&rsquo;&nbsp; Not sober-mindedness alone
comes to him who looks narrowly into himself, but great sorrow of heart
also.&nbsp; And if you are not both sobered in your mind and full of
an unquenchable sorrow in your heart, O yes! attend to it, for you are
not yet begun to be what God would have you to be.&nbsp; Dr. Newman,
with all his mistakes and all his faults, was a master in two things:
his own heart and the English language.&nbsp; And in writing home to
his mother a confidential letter from college on his birthday, he confides
to her that he often &lsquo;shudders at himself.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;No,&rsquo;
he answered to his mother&rsquo;s fears and advices about food and air
and exercise: &lsquo;No, I am neither nervous, nor in ill-health, nor
do I study too much.&nbsp; I am neither melancholy, nor morose, nor
austere, nor distant, nor reserved, nor sullen.&nbsp; I am always cheerful,
ready and eager to join in any merriment.&nbsp; I am not clouded with
sadness, nor absent in mind, nor deficient in action.&nbsp; No; take
me when I am most foolish at home and extend mirth into childishness;
yet all the time I am shuddering at myself.&rsquo;&nbsp; There spake
the future author of the immortal sermons.&nbsp; There spake a mind
and a heart that have deepened the minds and the hearts of Christian
men more than any other influence of the century; a mind and a heart,
moreover, that will shine and beat in our best literature and in our
deepest devotion for centuries to come.&nbsp; You must all know by this
time another classical passage from the pen of another spiritual genius
in the Church of England, that greatly gifted church.&nbsp; Let me repeat
it to illustrate how sober-mindedness and great sorrow of heart always
come to the best of men.&nbsp; &lsquo;Let any man consider that if the
world knew all that of him which he knows of himself; if they saw what
vanity and what passions govern his inside, and what secret tempers
sully and corrupt his best actions; and he would have no more pretence
to be honoured and admired for his goodness and wisdom than a rotten
and distempered body is to be loved and admired for its beauty and comeliness.&nbsp;
And, perhaps, there are very few people in the world who would not rather
choose to die than to have all their secret follies, the errors of their
judgments, the vanity of their minds, the falseness of their pretences,
the frequency of their vain and disorderly passions, their uneasinesses,
hatreds, envies, and vexations made known to the world.&nbsp; And shall
pride be entertained in a heart thus conscious of its own miserable
behaviour?&rsquo;&nbsp; No wonder that Mr. Prywell was sober-minded!&nbsp;
No wonder that Dr. Newman shuddered at himself!&nbsp; And no wonder
that William Law chose strangling and the pond rather than that any
other man should see what went on in his heart!</p>
<p>5.&nbsp; And as if all that were not enough, and more than enough,
to commend Mr. Prywell to us&mdash;to our trust, to our confidence,
and to our imitation&mdash;his royal certificate continues, &lsquo;One
that looks into the very bottom of matters, and talks nothing of news,
but by very solid arguments.&rsquo;&nbsp; The very bottom of matters&mdash;that
is, the very bottom of his own and other men&rsquo;s hearts.&nbsp; Mr.
Prywell counts nothing else worth a wise man&rsquo;s looking at.&nbsp;
Let fools and children look at the painted and deceitful surface of
things, but let men, men of matters, and especially men of divine matters,
look only at their own and other men&rsquo;s hearts.&nbsp; The very
bottom of all matters is there.&nbsp; All wars, all policies, all debates,
all disputes, all good and all evil counsels, all the much weal and
all the multitudinous woe of Mansoul&mdash;all have their bottom in
the heart; in the heart of God, or in the heart of man, or in the heart
of the devil.&nbsp; The heart is the root of absolutely every matter
to Mr. Prywell.&nbsp; He would not waste one hour of any day, or one
watch of any night, on anything else.&nbsp; And it was this that made
him both the extraordinarily successful scout he was, and the extraordinarily
sober and thoughtful and judicious man he was.&nbsp; O yes, my brethren,
the bottom of matters, when you take to it, will work the same change
in you.&nbsp; &lsquo;Two things,&rsquo; says one who had long looked
at his own matters with Mr. Prywell&rsquo;s eyes&mdash;&lsquo;two things,
O Lord, I recognise in myself: nature, which Thou hast made, and sin,
which I have added.&rsquo;&nbsp; My brethren, that recognition, that
discovery in yourselves, when it comes to you, will sober you as it
has sobered so many men before you: when it comes to you, that is, about
yourselves.&nbsp; That discovery made in yourselves will make you deep-thinking
men.&nbsp; It will make common men and unlearned men among you to be
philosophers and theologians and saints.&nbsp; It will work in you a
thoughtfulness, a seriousness, a depth, an awe, a holy fear, and a great
desire that will already have made you new creatures.&nbsp; When, in
examining yourselves and in characterising yourselves, you come on what
some clear-eyed men have come on in themselves, and what one of them
has described as &lsquo;the diabolical animus of the human mind&rsquo;&mdash;when
you make that discovery in yourselves, that will sober you, that will
humble you and fill you full of remorse and compunction.&nbsp; And if
in God&rsquo;s grace to you, that were to begin to be wrought in you
this week, there would be one, at any rate, eating of that bread next
Lord&rsquo;s day, and drinking of that cup as God would have it.</p>
<p>6.&nbsp; &lsquo;A man that is no tattler, nor raiser of false reports,
and that talks nothing of news, but by very solid arguments.&rsquo;&nbsp;
Mr. Prywell was more taken up with his own matters at home, far more
than the greatest busybodies are with other men&rsquo;s matters abroad.&nbsp;
His name, I fear, will still sound somewhat ill in your ears, but I
can assure you all the ill for you lies in the sound.&nbsp; Mr. Prywell
would not hurt a hair of your head: the truth is, he does not know whether
there is a hair on your head or no.&nbsp; This man&rsquo;s name comes
to him and sticks to him, not because he pries into your affairs, for
he does not, and never did, but because he is so drawn down into his
own.&nbsp; Mr. Prywell has no eye for your windows and he has no ear
for your doors.&nbsp; If your servant is a leaky slave, Prywell, of
all your neighbours, has no ear for his idle tales.&nbsp; This man is
no eavesdropper; your evil secrets have only a sobering and a saddening
and a silencing effect upon him.&nbsp; Your house might be full of skeletons
for anything he would ever discover or remember.&nbsp; The beam in his
own eye is so big that he cannot see past it to speak about your small
mote.&nbsp; &lsquo;The inward Christian,&rsquo; says &Agrave; Kempis,
&lsquo;preferreth the care of himself before all other cares.&nbsp;
He that diligently attendeth to himself can easily keep silence concerning
other men.&nbsp; If thou attendest unto God and unto thyself, thou wilt
be but little moved with what thou seest abroad.&rsquo;&nbsp; At the
same time, Mr. Prywell was no fool, and no coward, and no hoodwinked
witness.&nbsp; He could tell his tale, when it was demanded of him,
with such truth, and with such punctuality, and on such ample grounds,
that a conviction of the truth instantly fell on all who heard him.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Sirs,&rsquo; said those who heard him break silence, &lsquo;it
is not irrational for us to believe it,&rsquo; with such solid arguments
and with such an absence of mere suspicion and of all idle tales did
he speak.&nbsp; On one occasion, on a mere &lsquo;inkling,&rsquo; he
woke up the guard; only, it was so true an inkling that it saved the
city.&nbsp; But I cannot follow Mr. Prywell any further to-night.&nbsp;
How he went up and down Mansoul listening; how he kept his eyes and
his ears both shut and open; what splendid services he performed in
the progress, and specially toward the end, of the war; how the thanks
of the city were voted to him; how he was made Scoutmaster-general for
the good of the town of Mansoul, and the great conscience and good fidelity
with which he managed that great trust&mdash;all that you will read
for yourselves under this marginal index, &lsquo;The story of Mr. Prywell.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Now, my brethren, as the outcome of all that, we must all examine
ourselves as before God all this week.&nbsp; We must wait on His word
and on His providences while they examine us all this week.&nbsp; We
must pry well into ourselves all this week.&nbsp; Come, let us compel
ourselves to do it.&nbsp; Let us search and try our ways all this week
as we shall give an account.&nbsp; Let us ask ourselves how many Communion
tables we have sat at, and at how many more we are likely to sit.&nbsp;
Let us ask why it is that we have got so little good out of all our
Communions.&nbsp; Let us ask who is to blame for that, and where the
blame lies.&nbsp; Let us go to the bottom of matters with ourselves,
and compel ourselves to say just what it is that is the cause of God&rsquo;s
controversy with us.&nbsp; What vow, what solemn promise, made when
trouble was upon us, have we completely cast behind our back?&nbsp;
What about secret prayer?&nbsp; At what times, for what things, and
for what people do we in secret pray?&nbsp; What about secret sin?&nbsp;
What is its name, and what does it deserve, and what fruit are we already
reaping out of it?&nbsp; What is our besetting sin, and what steps do
we take, as God knows, to crucify it?&nbsp; Do we love money too much?&nbsp;
Do we love praise too much?&nbsp; Do we love eating and drinking too
much?&nbsp; Does envy make our heart a very hell?&nbsp; Let us name
the man we envy, and let us keep our Communion eye upon him.&nbsp; Let
us mix his name with all the psalms and prayers and sermons of this
Communion season.&nbsp; Or is it diabolical ill-will?&nbsp; Or is it
a wicked tongue against an unsuspecting friend?&nbsp; Let us examine
ourselves as Paul did, as Prywell did, and as God would have us do it,
and we shall discover things in ourselves so bad that if I were to put
words on them to-night, you would stop your ears in horror and flee
out of the church.&nbsp; Let a man see himself at least as others see
him; and then he will be led on from that to see himself as God sees
him; and then he will judge himself so severely as that he shall not
need to be judged at the Judgment Day, and will condemn himself so sufficiently
as that he shall not be condemned with a condemned world at the last.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XVI&mdash;YOUNG CAPTAIN SELF-DENIAL</h2>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;If any man will come after Me, let him deny himself
and take up his cross daily and follow Me.&rsquo;&mdash;<i>Our Lord</i>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&lsquo;Now the siege was long, and many a fierce attempt did the
enemy make upon the town, and many a shrewd brush did some of the townsmen
meet with from the enemy, especially Captain Self-denial, to whose care
both Ear-gate and Eye-gate had been intrusted.&nbsp; This Captain Self-denial
was a young man, but stout, and a townsman in Mansoul.&nbsp; This young
captain, therefore, being a hardy man, and a man of great courage to
boot, and willing to venture himself for the good of the town, he would
now and then sally out upon the enemy; but you must think this could
not easily be done, but he must meet with some sharp brushes himself,
and, indeed, he carried several of such marks on his face, yea, and
some on some other parts of his body.&rsquo;&nbsp; Thus, Bunyan.&nbsp;
I shall now go on to-night to offer you some annotations and some reflections
on this short but excellent history of young Captain Self-denial.</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; Well, to begin with, this Captain Self-denial was still
a young man.&nbsp; &lsquo;And, now, it comes into my mind, said Goodman
Gains after supper, I will tell you a story well worth the hearing,
as I think.&nbsp; There were two men once upon a time that went on pilgrimage;
the one began when he was young and the other began when he was old.&nbsp;
The young man had strong corruptions to grapple with, whereas the old
man&rsquo;s corruptions were decayed with the decays of nature.&nbsp;
The young man trod his steps as even as did the old one, and was every
way as light as he; who, now, or which of them, had their graces shining
clearest, since both seemed to be alike?&nbsp; Why, the young man&rsquo;s,
doubtless, answered Mr. Honest.&nbsp; For that which heads against the
greatest opposition gives best demonstration that it is strongest.&nbsp;
A young man, therefore, has the advantage of the fairest discovery of
a work of grace within him.&nbsp; And thus they sat talking till the
break of day.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Now, I have taken up Captain Self-denial to-night because the young
men and I are to begin a study to-night to which I was first attracted
because it taught me lessons about myself, and about self-denial, and
thus about both a young man&rsquo;s and an old man&rsquo;s deepest and
most persistent corruptions&mdash;lessons such as I have never been
taught in any other school.&nbsp; In all my philosophical, theological,
moral, and experimental reading, so to describe it, I have never met
with any school of authors for one moment to be compared with the great
evangelical mystics, especially when they treat of self, self-love,
self-denial, the daily cross, and all suchlike lessons.&nbsp; Take the
great doctrinal and experimental Puritans, such as John Owen, Thomas
Goodwin, Richard Baxter, John Howe, and Jonathan Edwards, and add on
to them the greatest and best mystics, such as Jacob Behmen, Thomas
&Agrave; Kempis, Francis F&eacute;nelon, Jeremy Taylor, Samuel Rutherford,
Robert Leighton, and William Law, and you will have the profoundest,
the most complete, the most perfect, and, I will add, the most fascinating
and enthralling of spiritual teaching in all the world.&nbsp; And I
will be bold enough to promise you that if you will but join our Young
Men&rsquo;s Class to-night, and will buy and read our mystical books,
and will resolve to put in practice what you hear and read in the class,
I will promise you, I say, that by the end of our short session you
will not only be ten times more open and hospitably-minded men, but
also ten times more spiritually-minded men, ten times more Christ-like
men, and with your joy in Christ and His joy in you all but full.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; The Captain Self-denial was a young man, and he was also
a townsman in Mansoul.&nbsp; Young Self-denial and one other were all
of Emmanuel&rsquo;s captains who were townsmen in Mansoul.&nbsp; All
his other captains Emmanuel had brought with him; but the Captains Self-denial
and Experience were both born and reared to their full manhood in that
besieged city.&nbsp; &lsquo;A townsman.&rsquo;&nbsp; How much there
is for us all in that one word!&nbsp; How much instruction!&nbsp; How
much encouragement!&nbsp; How much caution and correction!&nbsp; Our
greatest grace; our most essential and indispensable grace; our most
experimental and evidential grace; that grace, indeed, without which
all our other graces are but specious shows and painted surfaces of
graces; that grace into which our Lord here gathers up all our other
graces;&mdash;that greatest of graces cannot be imputed, imported, or
introduced; it must be born, bred, exercised, reared up to its full
maturity, and sent forth to fight and to conquer, and all within the
walls of its own native town; in short, our self-denial must have its
beginning and middle and end in our own heart.&nbsp; Antinomians there
were, as our Puritan fathers nicknamed all those persons who glorified
Christ by letting Him do all things for them, both His own things and
their things too, both their justification and their sanctification
too.&nbsp; And there are many good but ill-instructed men among ourselves
who have just this taint of that old heresy cleaving to them still&mdash;this
taint, namely, that they are tempted to carry over the suretyship and
substitutionary work of Christ into such regions, and to carry it to
such lengths in those regions, as, practically, to make Christ to minister
to their soft and sinful living, and to their excuse and indulgence
of themselves.&nbsp; I will put it squarely and plainly to some of my
very best friends here to-night.&nbsp; Is it not the case, now, that
you do not like this direction into which this text, and the truth of
this text, are now travelling?&nbsp; Is it not so that you shift back
in your seat from the approaching cross?&nbsp; Is it not the very and
actual fact that you have secret ways of sin, secret habits of self-indulgence
in your body and in your soul, in your mind and in your heart, secret
sins that you mantle over with the robe of Christ&rsquo;s righteousness?&nbsp;
His spotless and imputed righteousness?&nbsp; In your present temper
you would have disliked deeply the Sermon on the Mount had you heard
it; and I see you shaking your head over your Sabbath-day dinner at
this text when it was first spoken.&nbsp; Lay this down for a law, all
my brethren,&mdash;a New Testament and a never-to-be-abrogated law,&mdash;that
the best and the safest religion for you is that way of religion that
is hardest on your pride, on your self-importance, on your self-esteem,
as well as on your purse and on your belly.&nbsp; You are not likely
to err by practising too much of the cross.&nbsp; You may very well
have too much of the cross of Christ preached to you, and too little
of your own.&nbsp; Why! did not Christ die for me? you indignantly say.&nbsp;
Yes; so He did.&nbsp; But only that you might die too.&nbsp; He was
crucified, and so must you be crucified every day before one single
drop of His sin-atoning blood shall ever be wasted on You.&nbsp; Be
not deceived: the cross is not mocked; for only as a man nails himself,
body and soul, to the cross every day shall he ever be saved from sin
and death and hell by means of it.&nbsp; And, exactly as a man denies
himself&mdash;no more and no less&mdash;his appetites, his passions,
his thoughts and words and deeds, every day and every hour of every
day, just so much shall He who searches our hearts and sees us in secret,
acknowledge us, both every day now, and at the last day of all.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; This same Captain Self-denial, his history goes on, was
stout, he was an hardy man also, and a man of great courage.&nbsp; Stout
and hardy and of great courage at home, that is; in his own mind and
heart, soul and body, that is.&nbsp; Young Captain Self-denial was a
perfect hero at saying No! and at saying No! to himself.&nbsp; It is
a proverb that there is nothing so difficult as to say that monosyllable.&nbsp;
And the proverb is Scripture truth if you try to say No! to yourself.&nbsp;
It takes the very stoutest of hearts, the most noble, the most manly,
the most soldierly, and the most saintly of hearts to say No! to itself,
and to keep on saying No! to itself to the bitter end of every trial
and temptation and opportunity.&nbsp; I remember reading long ago a
page or two of a medical man&rsquo;s diary.&nbsp; And in it he made
a confession and an appeal I have never forgot; though, to my loss,
I have not always acted upon it.&nbsp; He said that for many years he
had never been entirely well.&nbsp; He had constant headaches and depressions,
and it was seldom that he was not to some extent out of sorts.&nbsp;
But, all the time, he had a shrewd guess within himself as to what was
the matter with him.&nbsp; He felt ashamed to confess it even to himself
that he over-ate himself every day at table; till, at last, summoning
up all divine and human help, he determined that, however hungry he
was, and however savoury the dish was, and however excellent the wine
was, he would never either ask for or accept a second helping.&nbsp;
And this was his testimony, that from that stout and hardy day he grew
better in health daily; &lsquo;my head became clear, my eye bright,
my complexion pure, my mind and feelings were redeemed from all clouds
and depressions.&nbsp; And to-day I am a younger man at fifty than I
was at thirty.&rsquo;&nbsp; Now, if just saying No! to himself and to
the waiter at table did work such a new birth in a confirmed gourmand
of middle life, what would it not have wrought for him had he carried
his answer stoutly and courageously through all the other parts of his
body and soul?&mdash;as perhaps he did.&nbsp; Perhaps, having tasted
the sweet beginnings of salvation, he carried his short and sure regimen
through.&nbsp; If he has done so, let him give us his full autobiography.&nbsp;
What a blessed, what a priceless book it would be!</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; Stout Captain Self-denial was commanded to begin his life
as an officer in Emmanuel&rsquo;s army by taking especial watch over
Ear-gate and Eye-gate; and at our last accounts of our abstemious doctor
he had only got the length of Mouth-gate.&nbsp; But having begun so
well with those three great outposts of the soul, if those two trusty
officers only held on, and played the man courageously enough, they
would soon be promoted to still more important, still more central,
and, if more difficult and dangerous, then also much more honourable
and remunerative posts.&nbsp; Appetite, deep and deadly as its evils
are, is, after all, only an outwork of the soul; and the same sharp
knife that the epicure and the sot in all their stages must put to their
throat, that same knife must be made to draw blood in all parts of their
mind and their heart, in their will and in their imagination, till a
perfect chorus of self-denials rings like noblest martial music through
all the gates, and streets, and fortresses, and strongholds, and very
palaces and temples of the soul.&nbsp; I shall here stand aside and
let the greatest of the English mystics speak to you on this present
point.&nbsp; &lsquo;When we speak of self-denial,&rsquo; he says, in
his <i>Christian Perfection</i>, &lsquo;we are apt to confine it to
eating and drinking: but we ought to consider that, though a strict
temperance be necessary in these things, yet that these are the easiest
and the smallest instances of self-denial.&nbsp; Pride, vanity, self-love,
covetousness, envy, and other inclinations of the like nature call for
a more constant and a more watchful self-denial than the appetites of
hunger and thirst.&nbsp; And till we enter into this course of universal
self-denial we shall make no progress in real piety, but our lives will
be a ridiculous mixture of I know not what; sober and covetous, proud
and devout, temperate and vain, regular in our forms of devotion and
irregular in all our passions, circumspect in little modes of behaviour
and careless and negligent of tempers the most essential to piety.&nbsp;
And thus it will necessarily be with us till we lay the axe to the root
of the tree, till we deny and renounce the whole corruption of our nature,
and resign ourselves up entirely to the Spirit of God, to think and
speak and act by the wisdom and the purity of religion.&rsquo;</p>
<p>5.&nbsp; Stout as Captain Self-denial was, and notable alarms and
some brisk execution as he did upon the enemy, yet he must meet with
some brushes himself; indeed, he carried several of the marks of such
brushes on his face as well as on some other parts of his body.&nbsp;
If I had read in his history that Young Captain Self-denial had left
his mark upon his enemies, I would have said, Well done, and I would
have added that I always expected as much.&nbsp; But it is far more
to my purpose to read that he had not always got himself off without
wounds that left lasting scars both where they were seen of all, and
where they were seen and felt only by Self-denial himself.&nbsp; And
not Self-denial only, but even Paul, in our flesh, and with like passions
with us, had the same experience and has left us the same record.&nbsp;
&lsquo;I keep my body under&rsquo;: so our emasculated English version
makes us read it.&nbsp; But the visual image in the masterly original
Greek is not so mealy-mouthed.&nbsp; I box and buffet myself day and
night, says Paul.&nbsp; I play the truculent tyrant over a lewd and
lazy slave.&nbsp; I hit myself blinding blows on my tenderest part.&nbsp;
I am ashamed to look at myself in the glass, for all under my eyes I
am black and blue.&nbsp; If David, after the matter of Uriah, had done
that to himself, and even more than that, we would not have wondered;
we would have expected it, and we would have said, It is no more than
we would have done ourselves.&nbsp; But that a spotless, gentle, noble
soul like Paul should so have mangled himself,&mdash;that quite dumfounders
us.&nbsp; If Paul, then, who, touching the righteousness which is in
the law, was blameless, had to handle himself in that manner in order
to keep himself blameless, shall any young man here hope to escape temptation
without such blows at himself as shall leave their mark on him all his
days?&nbsp; Nay, not only so, but after Self-denial had thus exercised
himself and subdued himself, still his enemy sometimes got such an advantage
over him as left him as his history here describes him.&nbsp; All which
is surely full of the most excellent heartening to all who read, in
earnest and for an example, his fine history.</p>
<p>6.&nbsp; The last and crowning exploit of our matchless captain was
to capture, and execute, and quarter, and hang up on a gallows at the
market-cross, the head and the hands and the feet of his oldest, most
sworn, and most deadly enemy, one Self-love.&nbsp; So stout and so insufferable
was our captain in the matter of Self-love that when it was proposed
by some of his many influential friends and high-in-place relations
in the city that the judgment of the court-martial on Self-love should
be deferred, our stout soldier with the cuts on his face and in some
other parts of his body stood up, and said that the city and the army
must make up their mind either to relieve him of his sword, hacked and
broken off as it was, or else to execute the law upon Self-love on the
spot.&nbsp; I will lay down my commission this very day, he said, with
an extraordinary indignation.&nbsp; Many rich men in the city, and many
men deep in the King&rsquo;s service, muttered mutinous things when
their near relative was hurried to the open cause-way, but by that time
the soldiers of Self-denial&rsquo;s company had brained Self-love with
the butts of their muskets.&nbsp; And it was the stand that our captain
made in the matter of Self-love that at last lifted the young soldier
where many had felt he should have been lifted long ago.&nbsp; From
that day he was made a lord, a military peer, and an adviser of the
crown and the crown officers in all the deepest counsels concerning
Mansoul.&nbsp; Only, with the cloak and the coronet of Self-denial the
present history all but comes to an end.&nbsp; For, before the outcast
remains of Self-love had mouldered to their dust on the city gate, the
King&rsquo;s chariot had descended into the street, had ascended up
to the palace at the head of the street, and a new age of the city life
had begun, the full history of which has yet to be told.</p>
<p>Remain behind, then, and begin with us to-night, all you young men.&nbsp;
You cannot begin this lifelong study and this lifelong pursuit of self-denial
too early.&nbsp; For, even if you begin to read our books and to practise
our discipline in your very boyhood, when you are old men and very saints
of God you will feel that your self-love is still so full of life and
power, that your self-denial has scarcely begun.&nbsp; Ah, me! men:
both old and young men.&nbsp; Ah, me! what a life&rsquo;s task set us
of God it is to make us a new heart, to cleanse out an unclean heart,
to lay in the dust a proud heart, and to keep a heart at all times,
and in all places, and toward all people, with all diligence!&nbsp;
Who is sufficient for these things?</p>
<p>&lsquo;Now was Christian somewhat in a maze.&nbsp; But at last, when
every man started back for fear, Christian saw a man of a very stout
countenance come up to him that sat there with the inkhorn to write,
saying, Set down my name, sir!&nbsp; At which there was a pleasant voice
heard from those that were within, even of those who walked upon the
top of that place, saying,</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Come in, come in:<br />
Eternal glory thou shalt win.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then Christian smiled, and said: I think, verily, that I know the
meaning of all this now.&rsquo;</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XVII&mdash;FIVE PICKT MEN</h2>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;I took wise men and known and made them captains.&rsquo;&mdash;<i>Moses</i>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>John Bunyan never lost his early love for a soldier&rsquo;s life
any more than he ever forgot the rare delights of his bell-ringing days.&nbsp;
John Bunyan, all his days, never saw a bell-rope that his fingers did
not tingle, and he never saw a soldier in uniform without instinctively
shouldering his youthful musket.&nbsp; Bunyan was one of those rare
men who are of imagination all compact; and consequently it is that
all his books are full of the scenes, the occupations, and the experiences
of his early days.&nbsp; Not that he says very much, in as many words,
about what happened to him in the days when he was a soldier; it is
only once in all his many books that he says that when he was a soldier
such and such a thing happened to him.&nbsp; At the same time, all his
books bear the impress of his early days upon them; and as for this
special book of Bunyan&rsquo;s now open before us, it is full from board
to board of the strife and the din of his early battles.&nbsp; The <i>Holy
War</i> is just John Bunyan&rsquo;s soldierly life spiritualised&mdash;spiritualised
and so worked up into this fine English Classic.</p>
<p>Well, then, after Mansoul was taken and reduced, the victorious Prince
determined so to occupy the town with His soldiers that it should never
again either be taken by force from without, or ever again revolt by
weakness or by fear from within.&nbsp; And with this view He chose out
five of His best captains&mdash;My five pickt men, He always called
them&mdash;and placed those five captains and their thousands under
them in the strongholds of the town.&nbsp; On the margin of this page
our versatile author speaks of that step of Emmanuel&rsquo;s in the
language of a philosopher, a moralist, and a divine.&nbsp; &lsquo;Five
graces,&rsquo; he says, &lsquo;pickt out of an abundance of common virtues.&rsquo;&nbsp;
This summing-up sentence stands on his stiff and dry margin.&nbsp; But
in the rich and living flow of the text itself our author goes on writing
like the man of genius he is.&nbsp; With all the warmth and colour and
dramatic movement of which this whole book is full, this great writer
goes on to set those five choice captains of our salvation before us
in a way that we shall never forget.</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; &lsquo;The first was that famous captain, the noble Captain
Credence.&nbsp; His were the red colours, and Mr. Promise bare them.&nbsp;
And for a scutcheon he had the Holy Lamb and the golden shield; and
he had ten thousand men at his feet.&rsquo;&nbsp; Now, this same Captain
Credence from first to last of the war always led the van both within
and around Mansoul.&nbsp; In ordinary and peaceful days; in days of
truce and parley; when the opposite armies were laid up in their winter
quarters, or were, for any cause, drawn off from one another, some of
the other captains might be more in evidence.&nbsp; But in every exploit
to be called an exploit; in every single enterprise of danger; when
any new position was to be taken up, or any forlorn hope was to be led,
there, in the very van of labour and of danger, was sure to be seen
Captain Credence with his blood-red colours in his own hand.&nbsp; You
understand your Bunyan by this time, my brethren?&nbsp; Captain Credence,
your little boy at school will tell you, is just the soldier-like faith
of your sanctification.&nbsp; <i>Credo</i>, he will tell you, is &lsquo;I
believe&rsquo;; it is to have faith in God and in the word of God.&nbsp;
You will borrow your Latin from your little boy, and then you will pay
him back by telling him how Captain Credence has always led the van
in your soul.&nbsp; You will tell him and show him what a wonderful
writer on the things of the soul John Bunyan is, till you make John
Bunyan one of your son&rsquo;s choicest authors for all his days.&nbsp;
You will do this if you will tell him how and when this same Captain
Credence with his crimson colours first led the van in your salvation.&nbsp;
You will tell him this with more and more depth and more and more plainness
as year after year he reads his <i>Holy War</i>, and better and better
understands it, till he has had it all fulfilled in himself as a pickt
captain and good soldier of Jesus Christ.&nbsp; You will tell him about
yourself, till, at this forlorn hope in his own life, and at that sounded
advance, in some new providence and in some new duty; in this commanded
attack on an inwardly entrenched enemy, and in that resolute assault
on some battlement of evil habit, he recollects his noble, confiding,
and loving father and plays the man again, and that all the more if
only for his father&rsquo;s sake.&nbsp; Ask your son what he knows and
what you do not know, and then as long as his heart and his ear are
open tell him what you know and what you have by faith come through,
and that will be a priceless possession to him, especially when he is
put in possession of it by you.</p>
<p>Well on toward the end of the war, the Captain Credence had so acquitted
himself that he was summoned one day to the Prince&rsquo;s quarters,
when the following colloquy ensued: &lsquo;What hath my Lord to say
to His servant?&rsquo;&nbsp; And then, after a sign or two of favour,
it was said to him: &lsquo;I have made thee lieutenant over all the
forces in Mansoul; so that, from this day forward, all men in Mansoul
shall be at thy word; and thou shalt be he that shall lead in and that
shall lead out Mansoul.&nbsp; And at thy command shall all the rest
of the captains be.&rsquo;&nbsp; My brethren, you will have the whole
key to all that in yourselves if this same war has gone this length
in you.&nbsp; Faith, your faith in God, and in the word of God, will,
as this inward war goes on, not only lead the van in your heart and
in your life, but just because your faith so leads in all things, and
is so fitted to lead in all things, it will at last be lifted up and
set over your soul, and all the things of your soul, till nothing shall
be done in any of the streets, or gates, or walls thereof that faith
in God and in His word does not first allow and admit.&nbsp; And then,
when it has come to that within you, that is the best mind, that is
the safest, the happiest, and the most heavenly mind that you can attain
to in this present life; and when faith shall thus lead and rule over
all things in thy soul, be thou always ready, for thy speedy translation
to a still better life is just at the door.</p>
<p>2. &lsquo;The second was that famous captain, Good-hope.&nbsp; His
were the blue colours.&nbsp; His standard-bearer was Mr. Expectation,
and for a scutcheon he had three golden anchors; and he had ten thousand
men at his feet.&rsquo;&nbsp; The time was, my brethren, when all your
hopes and mine were as yet anchored without the veil.&nbsp; But all
that is now changed.&nbsp; We still hope, in a mild kind of way, for
this thing and for that in this present life; but only in a mild kind
of way.&nbsp; It would not be right in us not to look forward, say,
from spring-time to summer, and from summer to harvest.&nbsp; If the
husbandman had not hope in the former and in the latter rain he would
not sow; and as it is with the husbandman so it is with us all: so ought
it to be, and so it must be.&nbsp; But we say God willing! all the time
that we plot and plan and hope.&nbsp; And we say God willing! no longer
with a sigh, but, now, always with a smile.&nbsp; In His will is our
tranquillity, we say, and we know that if it is not His will that this
and that slightly anchored hope should be fulfilled, then that only
means that all our hopes, to be called hopes, are soon to be realised.&nbsp;
Our green and salad days in the matter of hope are for ever past.&nbsp;
If we had it all absolutely secured to us that this world is still promising
to its salad dupes, it would not come within a thousand miles of satisfying
our hearts.&nbsp; Whether the hopes of our hearts are to be fulfilled
within the veil or no, that remains to be seen; but all the things without
the veil taken together do not any longer even pretend to promise a
hope to hearts like ours.&nbsp; Our Forerunner has carried away our
hearts with Him.&nbsp; We have no heart left for any one but Him, or
for anything without or within the veil that He is not and is not in.&nbsp;
And till that hope also has made us ashamed,&mdash;till He and His promises
have failed us like all the rest,&mdash;we are going to anchor our hearts
on that, and on that only, which we believe is with Him within the veil.&nbsp;
If our Forerunner also disappoints us; if we enter where He is, only
to find that He is not there; or that, though there, He is not able
to satisfy our hope in Him, and make us like Himself, then we shall
be of all men the most miserable.&nbsp; But not till then.&nbsp; No;
not till then.&nbsp; And thus it is that Captain Good-hope has his billet
in our heart; thus it is that his blue colours float over our house;
and thus it is that his three golden anchors are blazing out in all
their beauty on the best wall of our earthly house.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; &lsquo;The third was that valiant captain, the Captain Charity.&nbsp;
His standard-bearer was Mr. Pitiful, and for his scutcheon he had three
naked orphans embraced in his bosom; and he also had ten thousand men
at his feet.&rsquo;&nbsp; O Charity!&nbsp; O valiant and pitiful Charity!&nbsp;
Divine-natured and heavenly-minded Charity!&nbsp; When wilt thou come
and dwell in my heart?&nbsp; When, by thine indwelling, shall I be able
to love my neighbour, and all my neighbours, as myself?&nbsp; When,
in thy strength, shall I cease from repining at my neighbour&rsquo;s
good; and when shall I cease secretly rejoicing over his evil?&nbsp;
When shall I by thee renewing me, be made able to cease in everything
from seeking first my own will and my own way; my own praise and my
own glory?&nbsp; When shall it be as much my new nature to love my neighbour
as it is now my old nature to hate him?&nbsp; When shall I cease to
be so soon angry, and hard, and bitter, and scornful, and unrelenting,
and unforgiving?&nbsp; When shall my neighbour&rsquo;s presence, his
image, and his name always call up only love and honour, good-will and
affectionate delight?&nbsp; When and where shall I, under thee, feel
for the last time any evil of any kind in my heart against my brother?&nbsp;
Oh! to see the day when I shall suffer long and be kind!&nbsp; When
I shall never again vaunt myself or be puffed up!&nbsp; When I shall
bear all things, believe all things, hope all things, endure all things!&nbsp;
O blessed, blessed Charity! with thy divine heart, with thy dove-like
eyes, and with thy bosom full of pity, when wilt thou come into my sinful
heart and bring all heaven in with thee!&nbsp; O Charity! till thou
so comest I shall wait for thee.&nbsp; And, till thou comest, thy standard-bearer
shall be my door porter, and thy scutcheon shall hang night and day
at my door-post!</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; &lsquo;The fourth captain was that gallant commander, the
Captain Innocent.&nbsp; His standard-bearer was Mr. Harmless; his were
the white colours, and for his scutcheon he had three golden doves.&rsquo;&nbsp;
My brethren, how well it would have been with us to-day if we had always
lived innocently!&nbsp; Had we only been innocent of that man&rsquo;s,
and that man&rsquo;s, and that man&rsquo;s, and that man&rsquo;s hurt!&nbsp;
(Let us name all the men to ourselves.)&nbsp; How many men have we,
first and last, hurt!&nbsp; Some intentionally, and some unintentionally;
some deliberately, and some only by accident; some of malice, and some
only of misfortune; some innocently and unknowingly, and whom we never
properly hurt.&nbsp; Some, also, by our mere existence; some by our
best actions; some because we have helped and not hurt others; and some
out of nothing else but the pure original devilry of their own evil
hearts.&nbsp; And then, when we take all these men home to our hearts,
what hearts all these men give us!&nbsp; Who, then, is the man here
who has done to other men the most hurt?&nbsp; Who has caused or been
the occasion of most hurt?&nbsp; Let that so unhappy man just think
that the gallant commander, the Captain Innocent himself, with his white
colours and with his golden doves, is standing and knocking at your
evil door.&nbsp; O unhappy man!&nbsp; By all the hurt and harm you have
ever done&mdash;by all that you can never now undo&mdash;by those spotless
colours that are still snow and not yet scarlet as they wave over you&mdash;by
those three golden doves that are an emblem of the life that still lies
open before you, as well as an invitation to you to enter on that life&mdash;why
will you die of remorse and despair?&nbsp; Open the door of your heart
and admit Captain Innocent.&nbsp; He knows that of all hurtful men on
the face of the earth you are the most hurtful, but he is not on that
account afraid at you; indeed, it is on that account that he has come
so near to you.&nbsp; By admitting him, by enlisting under him, by serving
under him, some of the most hurtful and injurious men that ever lived
have lived after to be the most innocent and the most harmless of men,
with their hands washed every day in innocency, and with three golden
doves as the scutcheon of their new nature and their Christian character.&nbsp;
Oh come into my heart, Captain Innocent; there is room in my heart for
thee!</p>
<p>5.&nbsp; &lsquo;And then the fifth was that truly royal and well-beloved
captain, the Captain Patience.&nbsp; His standard-bearer was Mr. Suffer-long,
and for a scutcheon he had three arrows through a golden heart.&rsquo;&nbsp;
Three arrows through a golden heart!&nbsp; Most eloquent, most impressive,
and most instructive of emblems!&nbsp; First, a heart of gold, and then
that heart of gold pierced, and pierced, and then pierced again with
arrow after arrow.&nbsp; Patience was the last of Emmanuel&rsquo;s pickt
graces.&nbsp; Captain Patience with his pierced heart always brought
up the rear when the army marched.&nbsp; But when Captain Patience and
Mr. Suffer-long did enter and take up their quarters in any house in
Mansoul,&mdash;then was there no house more safe, more protected, more
peaceful, more quietly, sweetly, divinely happy than just that house
where this loyal and well-beloved captain bore in his heart.&nbsp; Entertain
patience, my brethren.&nbsp; Practise patience, my brethren.&nbsp; Make
your house at home a daily school to you in which to learn patience.&nbsp;
Be sure that you well understand the times, the occasions, the opportunities,
and the invitations of patience, and take profit out of them; and thus
both your profit and that of others also will be great.&nbsp; Tribulation
worketh patience.&nbsp; Endure tribulation, then, for the sake of its
so excellent work.&nbsp; Nothing worketh patience like tribulation,
and therefore it is that tribulation so abounds in the lives of God&rsquo;s
people.&nbsp; So much does tribulation abound in the lives of God&rsquo;s
people that they are actually known in heaven and described there by
their experience of tribulation.&nbsp; &lsquo;These are they which came
out of great tribulation, and therefore are they before the throne.&rsquo;&nbsp;
These are they with the three sharp arrows shot through and through
their hearts of gold.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XVIII&mdash;MR. DESIRES-AWAKE</h2>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;One thing have I desired.&rsquo;&mdash;<i>David</i>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mr. Desires-awake dwelt in a very mean cottage in Mansoul.&nbsp;
There were two very mean cottages in Mansoul, and those two cottages
stood beside one another and leaned upon one another and held one another
up.&nbsp; Mr. Desires-awake dwelt in the one of those cottages and Mr.
Wet-eyes in the other.&nbsp; And those two mendicant men were wont to
meet together for secret prayer, when Mr. Desires-awake would put a
rope upon his head, while Mr. Wet-eyes would not be able to speak for
wringing his hands in tears all the time.&nbsp; Many a time did those
two meanest and most despised of men deliver that city, according to
the proverb of the Preacher: Wisdom is better than strength, and the
words of wisdom are to be heard in secret places, where wisdom is far
better than weapons of war.&nbsp; Why should I not do all for them and
the best I can? said Mr. Desires-awake when the men of Mansoul came
to him in their extremity.&nbsp; I will even venture my life again for
them at the pavilion of the Prince.&nbsp; And accordingly this mean
man put his rope upon his head, as was his wont, and went out to the
Prince&rsquo;s tent and asked the reformades if he might see their Master.&nbsp;
Then the Prince, coming to the place where the petitioner lay on the
ground, demanded what his name was and of what esteem he was in Mansoul,
and why he, of all the multitudes of Mansoul, was sent out to His Royal
tent on such an errand.&nbsp; Then said the man to the Prince standing
over him, he said: Oh let not my Lord be angry; and why inquirest Thou
after the name of such a dead dog as I am?&nbsp; Pass by, I pray Thee,
and take not notice of who I am, because there is, as Thou very well
knowest, so great a disproportion between Thee and me.&nbsp; For my
part, I am out of charity with myself; who, then, should be in love
with me?&nbsp; Yet live I would, and so would I that my townsmen should;
and because both they and myself are guilty of great transgressions,
therefore they have sent me, and I have come in their names to beg of
my Lord for mercy.&nbsp; Let it please Thee, therefore, to incline to
mercy; but ask not who Thy servant is.&nbsp; All this, and how Mr. Desires-awake
and Mr. Wet-eyes sped in their petition, is to be read at length in
the Holy History.&nbsp; And now let us take down the key that hangs
in our author&rsquo;s window and go to work with it on the sweet mystery
of Mr. Desires-awake.</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; Well, then, to begin with, this poor man&rsquo;s name need
not delay us long seeking it out.&nbsp; In shorter time, and with surer
success than I could give you the dictionary root of his name, if you
will look within you will all see the visual image of this poor man&rsquo;s
name in your own heart.&nbsp; For our hearts are all as full as they
can hold of all kinds of desires; some good and some bad, some asleep
and some awake, some alive and some dead, some raging like a hundred
hungry lions, and some satisfied as a sleeping child.&nbsp; Well, then,
this mean man was called Mr. Desires-awake, and what his desires were
awake after and set upon we have already seen in his head-dress and
heard in his prayer.&nbsp; His house, on the other hand, will not be
so well known.&nbsp; For it was less a house than a hut&mdash;a hut
hidden away out of sight and back behind Mr. Wet-eyes&rsquo; hut.&nbsp;
Mr. Desires-awake&rsquo;s cottage was so mean and meagre that no one
ever came to visit him unless it was his next-door neighbour.&nbsp;
They never left their cottages, those two poor men, unless it was to
see one another; or, strange to tell, unless it was to go out at the
city gate to see and to speak with their Prince.&nbsp; And at such times
their venturesomeness both astonished themselves and amused their Prince.&nbsp;
Sometimes he laughed to see them back at his door again; but more often
he wept to see and hear them; all which made the guards of his pavilion
to wonder who those two strange men might be.&nbsp; And thus it was
that if at any long interval of time any of the men of the city desired
to see Mr. Desires-awake, he was sure to be found at the pavilion door
of his Prince, or else in his neighbour&rsquo;s cottage, or else at
home in his own.&nbsp; From year&rsquo;s end to year&rsquo;s end you
might look in vain for either of those two poor men in the public resorts
of Mansoul.&nbsp; When all the town was abroad on holidays and fair-days
and feast-days, those two mean men were then closest at home.&nbsp;
And when the booths of the town were full of all kinds of wares and
merchandise, and all the greens in the town were full of games, and
plays, and cheats, and fools, and apes, and knaves, only those two penniless
men would abide shut up at home.&nbsp; At home; or else together they
would go to a market-stance set up by their Prince outside the walls
where one was stationed to stand and to cry: &lsquo;Ho! every one that
thirsteth, come ye to the waters, and he that hath no money.&nbsp; Wherefore
do ye spend money for that which is not bread, and your labour for that
which satisfieth not?&nbsp; Incline your ear and come to me; hear, and
your soul shall live.&rsquo;&nbsp; And sometimes the Prince would go
out in person to meet the two men with nothing to pay, and would Himself
say to them, I counsel thee to buy of Me gold tried in the fire, and
white raiment, and anoint thine eyes with eye-salve, till the two men,
Mr. Desires-awake and Mr. Wet-eyes, would go home to their huts laden
with their Prince&rsquo;s free gifts and royal bounties.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; But, with all that, Mr. Desires-awake never went out to
his Prince&rsquo;s pavilion till he had again put his rope upon his
head.&nbsp; And, however laden with royal presents he ever returned
to his mean cottage, he never laid aside his rope.&nbsp; He ate in his
rope, he slept in his rope, he visited his next-door neighbour in his
rope, till the only instruction he left behind him was to bury him in
a ditch, and be sure to put his rope upon his head.&nbsp; The men and
the boys of the town jeered at Mr. Desires-awake as he passed up their
streets in his rope, and the very mothers in Mansoul taught their children
in arms to run after him and to cry, Go up, thou roped head!&nbsp; Go
up, thou roped head!&nbsp; We be free men, the men of the town called
after him; and we never were in bondage to any man&rsquo;.&nbsp; Out
with him; out with him!&nbsp; He is beside himself.&nbsp; Much repentance
hath made him mad!&nbsp; But through all that Mr. Desires-awake was
as one that heard them not.&nbsp; For Mr. Desires-awake was full of
louder voices within.&nbsp; The voices within his bosom quite drowned
the babel around him.&nbsp; The voices within called him far worse names
than the streets of the city ever called him; till all he could do was
to draw his rope down upon his head and press on again to the Prince&rsquo;s
pavilion.&nbsp; You understand about that rope, my brethren, do you
not?&nbsp; Mr. Desires-awake&rsquo;s continual rope?&nbsp; In old days
when a guilty man came of his own accord to the judge to confess himself
deserving of death, he would put a rope upon his head.&nbsp; And that
rope as much as said to the judge and to all men&mdash;the miserable
man as good as said: This is my desert.&nbsp; This is the wages of my
sin.&nbsp; I justify my judge.&nbsp; I judge myself.&nbsp; I hereby
do myself to death.&nbsp; And it was this that so angered the happy
holiday-makers of Mansoul.&nbsp; For they forgave themselves.&nbsp;
They justified themselves.&nbsp; They put a high price upon themselves.&nbsp;
Humiliation and sorrow for sin was not in all their thoughts; and they
hated and hunted back into his hut the humble man whose gait and garb
always reminded them of their past life and of their latter end.&nbsp;
But for all they could do, Mr. Desires-awake would wear his rope.&nbsp;
My soul chooseth strangling rather than sin, he would say.&nbsp; My
sin hath found me out, he would say; I hate myself, he would say, because
of my sin.&nbsp; I condemn and denounce myself.&nbsp; I hang myself
up with this rope on the accursed tree.&nbsp; And thus it was that while
other men were crucifying their Prince afresh, Mr. Desires-awake was
crucifying himself with and after his Prince.&nbsp; And thus it was
that while the men and the women of the town so hated and so mocked
Mr. Desires-awake, his Prince so loved and so honoured him.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; &lsquo;Oh let not my Lord be angry; and why inquirest Thou
after the name of such a dead dog as I am?&rsquo; said Desires-awake
to his Prince.&nbsp; &lsquo;Behold, now, I have taken upon me to speak
unto the Lord which am but dust and ashes,&rsquo; said Abraham.&nbsp;
&lsquo;If I wash myself with snow water, and make my hands never so
clean, yet shalt thou plunge me into the ditch, and mine own clothes
shall abhor me,&rsquo; said Job.&nbsp; &lsquo;My wounds stink and are
corrupt; my loins are filled with a loathsome disease, and there is
no soundness in my flesh,&rsquo; said David.&nbsp; &lsquo;But we are
all as an unclean thing,&rsquo; said Isaiah, &lsquo;and all our righteousnesses
are as filthy rags.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;I am the chief of sinners,&rsquo;
said the apostle.&nbsp; &lsquo;Hold your peace; I am a devil and not
a man,&rsquo; said Philip Neri to his sons.&nbsp; &lsquo;I am a sinner,
and worse than the chief of sinners, yea, a guilty devil,&rsquo; said
Samuel Rutherford.&nbsp; &lsquo;I hated the light; I was a chief&mdash;the
chief of sinners,&rsquo; said Oliver Cromwell.&nbsp; &lsquo;I was more
loathsome in my own eyes than a toad,&rsquo; said John Bunyan.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Sin and corruption would as naturally bubble out of my heart
as water would bubble out of a fountain.&nbsp; I could have changed
hearts with anybody.&nbsp; I thought none but the devil himself could
equal me for wickedness and pollution of mind.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;O
Despise me not,&rsquo; said Bishop Andrewes, &lsquo;an unclean worm,
a dead dog, a putrid corpse.&nbsp; The just falleth seven times a day;
and I, an exceeding sinner, seventy times seven.&nbsp; Me, O Lord, of
sinners chief, chiefest, and greatest.&rsquo;&nbsp; And William Law,
&lsquo;An unclean worm, a dead dog, a stinking carcass.&nbsp; Drive,
I beseech Thee, the serpent and the beast out of me.&nbsp; O Lord, I
detest and abhor myself for all these my sins, and for all my abuse
of Thine infinite mercy.&rsquo;&nbsp; From all this, then, you will
see that this dead dog of ours with the rope upon his head was no strange
sight at Emmanuel&rsquo;s pavilion.&nbsp; And you and I shall still
be in the same saintly succession if we go continually with his words
in our mouth, and with his instrument in our hands and on our heads.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; &lsquo;The Prince to whom I went,&rsquo; said Mr. Desires-awake,
&lsquo;is such a one for beauty and for glory that whoso sees Him must
ever after both love and fear Him.&nbsp; I, for my part,&rsquo; he said,
&lsquo;can do no less; but I know not what the end will be of all these
things.&rsquo;&nbsp; What made Mr. Desires-awake say that last thing
was that when he was prostrate in his prayer the Prince turned His head
away, as if He was out of humour and out of patience with His petitioner;
while, all the time, the overcome Prince was weeping with love and with
pity for Desires-awake.&nbsp; Only that poor man did not see that, and
would not have believed that even if he had seen it.&nbsp; &lsquo;I
cannot tell what the end will be,&rsquo; said Desires-awake; &lsquo;but
one thing I know, I shall never be able to cease from both loving and
fearing that Prince.&nbsp; I shall always love Him for His beauty and
fear Him for His glory.&rsquo;&nbsp; Can you say anything like that,
my brethren?&nbsp; Have you been at His seat with sackcloth, and a rope,
and ashes, and tears, and prayers, like Abraham, and David, and Isaiah,
and Paul, and John Bunyan, and Bishop Andrewes?&nbsp; And, whatever
may be the end, do you say that henceforth and for ever you must both
love and fear that Prince?&nbsp; &lsquo;Though He slay me,&rsquo; said
Job, &lsquo;yet I shall both love and trust Him.&rsquo;&nbsp; Well,
the Prince is the Prince, and He will take both His own time and His
own way of taking off your rope and putting a chain of gold round your
neck, and a new song in your mouth, as He did to Job.&nbsp; There may
be more weeping yet, both on your side and on His before He does that;
but He will do it, and He will not delay an hour that He can help in
doing it.&nbsp; Only, do you continue and increase to love His beauty,
and to fear His glory.&nbsp; And that of itself will be reward and blessing
enough to you.&nbsp; Nay, once you have seen both His beauty and His
glory, then to lie a dog under His table, and to beg at His door with
a rope on your head to all eternity would be a glorious eternity to
you.&nbsp; Samuel Rutherford said that to see Christ through the keyhole
once in a thousand years would be heaven enough for him.&nbsp; Christ
wept in heaven as Rutherford wrote that letter in Aberdeen, and if you
make Him weep in the same way He will soon make you to laugh too.&nbsp;
He will soon make you to laugh as Samuel Rutherford and Mr. Desires-awake
are laughing now.&nbsp; Only, my brethren, answer this&mdash;Are your
desires awakened indeed after Jesus Christ?&nbsp; You know what a desire
is.&nbsp; Your hearts are full to the brim of desires.&nbsp; Well, is
there one desire in a day in your heart for Christ?&nbsp; In the multitude
of your desires within you, what share and what proportion go out and
up to Christ?&nbsp; You know what beauty is.&nbsp; You know and you
love the beauty of a child, of a woman, of a man, of nature, of art,
and so on.&nbsp; Do you know, have you ever seen, the ineffable beauty
of Christ?&nbsp; Is there one saint of God here,&mdash;and He has many
saints here&mdash;is there one of you who can say with David in the
text, One thing do I desire?&nbsp; There should be many so desiring
saints here; for Christ&rsquo;s beauty is far better and far fairer,
far more captivating, far more enthralling, and far more satisfying
to us than it could be to David.&nbsp; Shall we call you Desires-awake,
then, after this?&nbsp; Can you say&mdash;do you say, One thing do I
desire, and that is no thing and no person, no created beauty and no
earthly sweetness, but my one desire is for God: to be His, and to be
like Him, and to be for ever with Him?&nbsp; Then, it shall soon all
be.&nbsp; For, what you truly desire,&mdash;all that you already are;
and what you already are,&mdash;all that you shall soon completely and
for ever be.&nbsp; Whom have I in heaven but Thee?&nbsp; And there is
none upon earth that I desire beside Thee.&nbsp; My flesh and my heart
faileth; but God is the strength of my heart, and my portion for ever.</p>
<p>&lsquo;As for me,&rsquo; says the great-hearted, the hungry-hearted
Psalmist, &lsquo;I shall be satisfied, when I awake, with Thy likeness.&rsquo;&nbsp;
One would have said that David had all that heart could desire even
before he fell asleep.&nbsp; For he had a throne, the throne of Israel,
and a son, a son like Solomon to sit upon it.&nbsp; A long life also,
full to the brim of all kinds of temporal and spiritual blessings.&nbsp;
Bless the Lord, O my soul, and forget not all His benefits; who forgiveth
all thine iniquities; who healeth all thy diseases; who redeemeth thy
life from destruction; who crowneth thee with loving-kindness and tender
mercies; who satisfieth thy mouth with good things, so that thy youth
is renewed like the eagle&rsquo;s.&nbsp; All that, and yet not satisfied!&nbsp;
O David! David! surely Desires-awake is thy new name!&nbsp; One of our
own poets has said:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;All thoughts, all passions, all delights,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Whatever stirs this mortal frame,<br />
All are but ministers of Love,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And feed His sacred flame.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now, if that is true, as it is true, even of earthly and ephemeral
love, how much more true is it of the love that is in the immortal soul
of man for the everlasting God?&nbsp; And what a blessed life that already
is when all things that come to us&mdash;joy and sorrow, good and evil,
nature and grace, all thoughts, all passions, all delights&mdash;are
all but so many ministers to our soul&rsquo;s desire after God, after
the Divine Likeness and for the Beatific Vision.</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Oh!&nbsp; Christ, He is the Fountain,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The deep sweet Well of Love!<br />
The streams on earth I&rsquo;ve tasted,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; More deep I&rsquo;ll drink above;<br />
There, to an ocean fulness,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; His mercy doth expand;<br />
And glory&mdash;glory dwelleth<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In Emmanuel&rsquo;s land.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>CHAPTER XIX&mdash;MR. WET-EYES</h2>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Oh that my head were waters!&rsquo;&mdash;<i>Jeremiah</i>.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Tears gain everything.&rsquo;&mdash;<i>Teresa</i>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now Mr. Desires-awake, when he saw that he must go on this errand,
besought that they would grant that Mr. Wet-eyes might go with him.&nbsp;
Now this Mr. Wet-eyes was a near neighbour of Mr. Desires-awake, a poor
man, and a man of a broken spirit, yet one that could speak well to
a petition; so they granted that he should go with him.&nbsp; Wherefore
the two men at once addressed themselves to their serious business.&nbsp;
Mr. Desires-awake put his rope upon his head, and Mr. Wet-eyes went
with his hands wringing together.&nbsp; Then said the Prince, And what
is he that is become thy companion in this so weighty a matter?&nbsp;
So Mr. Desires-awake told Emmanuel that this was a poor neighbour of
his, and one of his most intimate associates.&nbsp; And his name, said
he, may it please your most excellent Majesty, is Wet-eyes, of the town
of Mansoul.&nbsp; I know that there are many of that name that are naught,
said he; but I hope it will be no offence to my Lord that I have brought
my poor neighbour with me.&nbsp; Then Mr. Wet-eyes fell on his face
to the ground, and made this apology for his coming with his neighbour
to his Lord:&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, my Lord,&rsquo; quoth he, &lsquo;what I am I know not
myself, nor whether my name be feigned or true, especially when I begin
to think what some have said, and that is that this name was given me
because Mr. Repentance was my father.&nbsp; But good men have sometimes
bad children, and the sincere do sometimes beget hypocrites.&nbsp; My
mother also called me by this name of mine from my cradle; but whether
she said so because of the moistness of my brain, or because of the
softness of my heart, I cannot tell.&nbsp; I see dirt in mine own tears,
and filthiness in the bottom of my prayers.&nbsp; But I pray Thee (and
all this while the gentleman wept) that Thou wouldst not remember against
us our transgressions, nor take offence at the unqualifiedness of Thy
servants, but mercifully pass by the sin of Mansoul, and refrain from
the magnifying of Thy grace no longer.&rsquo;&nbsp; So at His bidding
they arose, and both stood trembling before Him.</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; &lsquo;His name, may it please your Majesty, is Wet-eyes,
of the town of Mansoul.&nbsp; I know, at the same time, that there are
many of that name that are naught.&rsquo;&nbsp; Naught, that is, for
this great enterprise now in hand.&nbsp; And thus it was that Mr. Desires-awake
in setting out for the Prince&rsquo;s pavilion besought that Mr. Wet-eyes
might go with him.&nbsp; Mr. Desires-awake felt keenly how much might
turn on who his companion was that day, and therefore he took Mr. Wet-eyes
with him.&nbsp; David would have made a most excellent associate for
Mr. Desires-awake that day.&nbsp; &lsquo;I am weary with my groaning;
all the night make I my bed to swim; I water my couch with my tears.&rsquo;&nbsp;
And again, &lsquo;Rivers of waters run down mine eyes, because they
keep not Thy law.&rsquo;&nbsp; This, then, was the only manner of man
that Mr. Desires-awake would stake his life alongside of that day.&nbsp;
&lsquo;I have seen some persons weep for the loss of sixpence,&rsquo;
said Mr. Desires-awake, &lsquo;or for the breaking of a glass, or at
some trifling accident.&nbsp; And they cannot pretend to have their
tears valued at a bigger rate than they will confess their passion to
be when they weep.&nbsp; Some are vexed for the dirtying of their linen,
or some such trifle, for which the least passion is too big an expense.&nbsp;
And thus it is that a man cannot tell his own heart simply by his tears,
or the truth of his repentance by those short gusts of sorrow.&rsquo;&nbsp;
Well, then, my brethren, tell me, Do you think that Mr. Desires-awake
would have taken you that day to the pavilion door?&nbsp; Would his
head have been safe with you for his associate?&nbsp; Your associates
see many gusts in your heart.&nbsp; Do they ever see your eyes red because
of your sin?&nbsp; Did you ever weep so much as one good tear-drop for
pure sin?&nbsp; One true tear: not because your sins have found you
out, but for secret sins that you know can never find you out in this
world?&nbsp; And, still better, do you ever weep in secret places not
for sin, but for sinfulness&mdash;which is a very different matter?&nbsp;
Do you ever weep to yourself and to God alone over your incurably wicked
heart?&nbsp; If not, then weep for that with all your might, night and
day.&nbsp; No mortal man has so much cause to weep as you have.&nbsp;
Go to God on the spot, on every spot, and say with Bishop Andrewes,
who is both Mr. Desires-awake and Mr. Wet-eyes in one, say with that
deep man in his <i>Private Devotions</i>, say: &lsquo;I need more grief,
O God; I plainly need it.&nbsp; I can sin much, but I cannot correspondingly
repent.&nbsp; O Lord, give me a molten heart.&nbsp; Give me tears; give
me a fountain of tears.&nbsp; Give me the grace of tears.&nbsp; Drop
down, ye heavens, and bedew the dryness of my heart.&nbsp; Give me,
O Lord, this saving grace.&nbsp; No grace of all the graces were more
welcome to me.&nbsp; If I may not water my couch with my tears, nor
wash Thy feet with my tears, at least give me one or two little tears
that Thou mayest put into Thy bottle and write in Thy book!&rsquo;&nbsp;
If your heart is hard, and your eyes dry, make something like that your
continual prayer.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; &lsquo;A poor-man,&rsquo; said Mr. Desires-awake, about
his associate.&nbsp; &lsquo;Mr. Wet-eyes is a poor man, and a man of
a broken spirit.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Let Oliver take comfort in his
dark sorrows and melancholies.&nbsp; The quantity of sorrow he has,
does it not mean withal the quantity of sympathy he has, and the quantity
of faculty and of victory he shall yet have?&nbsp; Our sorrow is the
inverted image of our nobleness.&nbsp; The depth of our despair measures
what capability and height of claim we have to hope.&nbsp; Black smoke,
as of Tophet, filling all your universe, it can yet by true heart-energy
become flame, and the brilliancy of heaven.&nbsp; Courage!&rsquo;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;This is the angel of the earth,<br />
And she is always weeping.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>3.&nbsp; &lsquo;A poor man, and a man of a broken spirit, and yet
one that can speak well to a petition.&rsquo;&nbsp; Yes; and you will
see how true that eulogy of Mr. Wet-eyes is if you will run over in
your mind the outstanding instances of successful petitioners in the
Scriptures.&nbsp; As you come down the Old and the New Testaments you
will be astonished and encouraged to find how prevailing a fountain
of tears always is with God.&nbsp; David with his swimming bed; Jeremiah
with his head waters; Mary Magdalene over His feet with her welling
eyes; Peter&rsquo;s bitter cry all his life long as often as he heard
a cock crow, and so on.&nbsp; So on through a multitude whose names
are written in heaven, and who went up to heaven all the way with inconsolable
sorrow because of their sins.&nbsp; They took words and turned to the
Lord; but,&mdash;better than the best words,&mdash;they took tears,
or rather, their tears took them.&nbsp; The best words, the words that
the Holy Ghost Himself teacheth, if they are without tears, will avail
nothing.&nbsp; Even inspired words will not pass through; while, all
the time, tears, mere tears, without words, are omnipotent with God.&nbsp;
Words weary Him, while tears overcome and command Him.&nbsp; He inhabits
the tears of Israel.&nbsp; Therefore, also, now, saith the Lord, turn
ye unto Me with all your heart, and with weeping and with mourning.&nbsp;
And rend your heart, and not your garments, and turn unto the Lord your
God, for He is gracious and merciful, slow to anger, and of great kindness,
and repenteth Him of the evil.&nbsp; It is the same with ourselves.&nbsp;
Tears move us.&nbsp; Tears melt us.&nbsp; We cannot resist tears.&nbsp;
Even counterfeit tears, we cannot be sure that they are not true.&nbsp;
And that is the main reason why our Lord is so good at speaking to a
petition.&nbsp; It is because His whole heart, and all the moving passions
of His heart, are in His intercessory office.&nbsp; It is because He
still remembers in the skies His tears, His agonies, and cries.&nbsp;
It is because He is entered into the holiest with His own tears as well
as with His own blood.&nbsp; And it is because He will remain and abide
before the Father the Man of Sorrows till our last petition is answered,
and till God has wiped the last tear from our eyes.&nbsp; When He was
in the coasts of C&aelig;sarea-Philippi, our Lord felt a great curiosity
to find out who the people thereabouts took Him to be.&nbsp; And it
must have touched His heart to be told that some men had insight enough
to insist that He was the prophet Jeremiah come back again to weep over
Jerusalem.&nbsp; He is Elias, said some.&nbsp; No; He is John the Baptist
risen from the dead, said others.&nbsp; No, no; said some men who saw
deeper than their neighbours.&nbsp; His head is waters, and His eyes
are a fountain of tears.&nbsp; Do you not see that He so often escapes
into a lodge in the wilderness to weep for our sins?&nbsp; No; He is
neither John nor Elijah; He is Jeremiah come back again to weep over
Jerusalem!&nbsp; And even an apostle, looking back at the beginning
of our Lord&rsquo;s priesthood on earth, says that He was prepared for
His office by prayers and supplications, and with strong crying and
tears.&nbsp; From all that, then, let us learn and lay to heart that
if we would have one to speak well to our petitions, the Man of Sorrows
is that one.&nbsp; And then, as His remembrancers on our behalf, let
us engage all those among our friends who have the same grace of tears.&nbsp;
But, above all, let us be men of tears ourselves.&nbsp; For all the
tears and all the intercessions of our great High Priest, and all the
importunings of our best friends to boot, will avail us nothing if our
own eyes are dry.&nbsp; Let us, then, turn back to Bishop Andrewes&rsquo;s
prayer for the grace of tears, and offer it every night with him till
our head, like his, is holy waters, and till, like him, we get beauty
for ashes, the oil of joy for mourning, and the garment of praise for
the spirit of heaviness.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; &lsquo;Clear as tears&rsquo; is a Persian proverb when they
would praise their purest spring water.&nbsp; But Mr. Wet-eyes has from
henceforth spoiled the point of that proverb for us.&nbsp; &lsquo;I
see,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;dirt in mine own tears, and filthiness in
the bottom of my prayers.&rsquo;&nbsp; Mr. Wet-eyes is hopeless.&nbsp;
Mr. Wet-eyes is intolerable.&nbsp; Mr. Wet-eyes would weary out the
patience of a saint.&nbsp; There is no satisfying or pacifying or ever
pleasing this morbose Mr. Wet-eyes.&nbsp; The man is absolutely insufferable.&nbsp;
Why, prayers and tears that the most and best of God&rsquo;s people
cannot attain to are spurned and spat upon by Mr. Wet-eyes.&nbsp; The
man is beside himself with his tears.&nbsp; For, tears that would console
and assure us for a long season after them, he will weep over them as
we scarce weep over our worst sins.&nbsp; His closet always turns all
his comeliness to corruption.&nbsp; He comes out of his closet after
all night in it with his psalm-book wrung to pulp, and with all his
righteousnesses torn to filthy rags; till all men escape Mr. Wet-eyes&rsquo;
society&mdash;all men except Mr. Desires-awake.&nbsp; I will go out
on your errand now, said Mr. Desires-awake, if you will send Mr. Wet-eyes
with me.&nbsp; And thus the two twin sons of sorrow for sin and hunger
after holiness went out arm in arm to the great pavilion together, Mr.
Desires-awake with his rope upon his head, and Mr. Wet-eyes with his
hands wringing together.&nbsp; Thus they went to the Prince&rsquo;s
pavilion.&nbsp; I gave you a specimen of one of Mr. Wet-eyes&rsquo;
prayers in the introduction to this discourse, and you did not discover
much the matter with it, did you?&nbsp; You did not discover much filthiness
in the bottom of that prayer, did you?&nbsp; I am sure you did not.&nbsp;
Ah! but that is because you have not yet got Mr. Wet-eyes&rsquo; eyes.&nbsp;
When you get his eyes; when you turn and employ upon yourselves and
upon your tears and upon your prayers his always-wet eyes,&mdash;then
you will begin to understand and love and take sides with this inconsolable
soul, and will choose his society rather than that of any other man&mdash;as
often, at any rate, as you go out to the Prince&rsquo;s pavilion door.</p>
<p>5.&nbsp; &lsquo;Mr. Repentance was my father, but good men sometimes
have bad children, and the most sincere do sometimes beget great hypocrites.&nbsp;
But, I pray Thee, take not offence at the unqualifiedness of Thy servant.&rsquo;&nbsp;
Take good note of that uncommon expression, &lsquo;unqualifiedness,&rsquo;
in Mr. Wet-eyes&rsquo; confession, all of you who are attending to what
is being said.&nbsp; Lay &lsquo;unqualifiedness&rsquo; to heart.&nbsp;
Learn how to qualify yourselves before you begin to pray.&nbsp; In his
fine comment on the 137th Psalm, Matthew Henry discourses delightfully
on what he calls &lsquo;deliberate tears.&rsquo;&nbsp; Look up that
raciest of commentators, and see what he there says about the deliberate
tears of the captives in Babylon.&nbsp; It was the lack of sufficient
deliberation in his tears that condemned and alarmed Mr. Wet-eyes that
day.&nbsp; He felt now that he had not deliberated and qualified himself
properly before coming to the Prince&rsquo;s pavilion.&nbsp; Do not
take up your time or your thoughts with mere curiosities, either in
your Bible or in any other good book, says &Agrave; Kempis.&nbsp; Read
such things rather as may yield compunction to your heart.&nbsp; And
again, give thyself to compunction, and thou shalt gain much devotion
thereby.&nbsp; Mr. Wet-eyes, good and true soul, was afraid that he
had not qualified himself enough by compunctious reading and self-recollection.&nbsp;
The sincere, he sobbed out, do often beget hypocrites!&nbsp; &lsquo;Our
hearts are so deceitful in the matter of repentance,&rsquo; says Jeremy
Taylor, &lsquo;that the masters of the spiritual life are fain to invent
suppletory arts and stratagems to secure the duty.&rsquo;&nbsp; Take
not offence at the lack of all such suppletory arts and stratagems in
thy servant, said poor Wet-eyes.&nbsp; All which would mean in the most
of us: Take not offence at my rawness and ignorance in the spiritual
life, and especially in the life of inward devotion.&nbsp; Do not count
up against me the names and the numbers and the prices of my poems,
and plays, and novels, and newspapers, and then the number of my devotional
books.&nbsp; Compare not my outlay on my body and on this life with
my outlay on my soul and on the life to come.&nbsp; Oh, take not mortal
offence at the shameful and scandalous unqualifiedness of Thy miserable
servant.&nbsp; My father and my mother read the books of the soul, but
they have left behind them a dry-eyed reprobate in me!&nbsp; Say that
to-night as you look around on the grievous famine of the suppletory
arts and stratagems of repentance and reformation in your heathenish
bedroom.</p>
<p>Spiritual preaching; real face to face, inward, verifiable, experimental,
spiritual preaching; preaching to a heart in the agony of its sanctification;
preaching to men whose whole life is given over to making them a new
heart&mdash;that kind of preaching is scarcely ever heard in our day.&nbsp;
There is great intellectual ability in the pulpit of our day, great
scholarship, great eloquence, and great earnestness, but spiritual preaching,
preaching to the spirit&mdash;&lsquo;wet-eyed&rsquo; preaching&mdash;is
a lost art.&nbsp; At the same time, if that living art is for the present
overlaid and lost, the literature of a deeper spiritual day abides to
us, and our spiritually-minded people are not confined to us, they are
not dependent on us.&nbsp; Well, this is the Communion week with us
yet once more.&nbsp; Will you not, then, make it the beginning of some
of the suppletory arts and stratagems of the spiritual life with yourselves?&nbsp;
I cannot preach as I would like on such subjects, but I can tell you
who could, and who, though dead, yet speak by their immortal books.&nbsp;
You have the wet-eyed psalms; but they are beyond the depth of most
people.&nbsp; Their meaning seems to us on the surface, and we all read
and sing them, but let us not therefore think that we understand them.&nbsp;
I cannot compel you to read the books, and to read little else but the
books, that would in time, and by God&rsquo;s blessing, lead you into
the depths of the psalms; but I can wash my hands so far in making their
names so many household words among my people.&nbsp; The <i>Way to Christ</i>,
the <i>Imitation of Christ</i>, the <i>Theologia Germanica</i>, Tauler&rsquo;s
<i>Sermons</i>, the <i>Mortification of Sin</i>, and <i>Indwelling Sin
in Believers</i>, the <i>Saint&rsquo;s Rest</i>, the <i>Holy Living
and Dying</i>, the <i>Privata Sacra</i>, the <i>Private Devotions</i>,
the <i>Serious Call</i>, the <i>Christian Perfection</i>, the <i>Religious
Affections</i>, and such like.&nbsp; All that, and you still unqualified!&nbsp;
All that, and your eyes still dry!</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XX&mdash;MR. HUMBLE THE JURYMAN, AND MISS HUMBLE-MIND THE
SERVANT-MAID</h2>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Learn of Me, for I am meek and lowly in heart.&rsquo;&mdash;<i>Our
Lord</i>.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Be clothed with humility.&rsquo;&mdash;<i>Peter</i>.</p>
<p>&lsquo;God&rsquo;s chiefest saints are the least in their own eyes.&rsquo;&mdash;<i>&Agrave;
Kempis</i>.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Without humility all our other virtues are but vices.&rsquo;&mdash;<i>Pascal</i>.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Humility does not consist in having a worse opinion of ourselves
than we deserve.&rsquo;&mdash;<i>Law</i>.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Humility lies close upon the heart, and its tests are exceedingly
delicate and subtle.&rsquo;&mdash;<i>Newman</i>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Our familiar English word &lsquo;humility&rsquo; comes down to us
from the Latin root <i>humus</i>, which means the earth or the ground.&nbsp;
Humility, therefore, is that in the mind and in the heart of a man which
is low down even to the very earth.&nbsp; A humble-minded man may not
have learning enough to know the etymology of the name which best describes
his character, but the divine nature which is in him teaches him to
look down, to walk meekly and softly, and to speak seldom, and always
in love.&nbsp; For humility, while it takes its lowly name from earth,
all the time has its true nature from heaven.&nbsp; Humility is full
of all meekness, modesty, submissiveness, teachableness, sense of inability,
sense of unworthiness, sense of ill-desert.&nbsp; Till, with that new
depth and new intensity that the Scriptures and religious experience
have given to this word, as to so many other words, humility, in the
vocabulary of the spiritual life, has come to be applied to that low
estimate of ourselves which we come to form and to entertain as we are
more and more enlightened about God and about ourselves; about the majesty,
glory, holiness, beauty, and blessedness of the divine nature, and about
our own unspeakable evil, vileness, and misery as sinners.&nbsp; And,
till humility has come to rank in Holy Scripture, and in the lives and
devotions of all God&rsquo;s saints, as at once the deepest root and
the ripest fruit of all the divine graces that enter into, and, indeed,
constitute the life of God in the heart of man.&nbsp; Humility, evangelical
humility, sings Edwards in his superb and seraphic poem the <i>Religious
Affections</i>,&mdash;evangelical humility is the sense that the true
Christian has of his own utter insufficiency, despicableness, and odiousness,
a sense which is peculiar to the true saint.&nbsp; But to compensate
the true saint for this sight and sense of himself, he has revealed
to him an accompanying sense of the absolutely transcendent beauty of
the divine nature and of all divine things; a sight and a sense that
quite overcome the heart and change to holiness all the dispositions
and inclinations and affections of the heart.&nbsp; The essence of evangelical
humility, says Edwards, consists in such humility as becomes a creature
in himself exceeding sinful, but at the same time, under a dispensation
of grace, and this is the greatest and most essential thing in all true
religion.</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; Well, then, our Mr. Humble was a juryman in Mansoul, and
his name and his nature eminently fitted him for his office.&nbsp; I
never was a juryman; but, if I were, I feel sure I would come home from
the court a far humbler man than I went up to it.&nbsp; I cannot imagine
how a judge can remain a proud man, or an advocate, or a witness, or
a juryman, or a spectator, or even a policeman.&nbsp; I am never in
a criminal court that I do not tremble with terror all the time.&nbsp;
I say to myself all the time,&mdash;there stands John Newton but for
the preventing grace of God.&nbsp; &lsquo;I will not sit as a judge
to try General Boulanger, because I hate him,&rsquo; said M. Renault
in the French Senate.&nbsp; Mr. Humble himself could not have made a
better speech to the bench than that when his name was called to be
sworn.&nbsp; Let us all remember John Newton and M. Renault when we
would begin to write or to speak about any arrested, accused, found-out
man.&nbsp; Let other men&rsquo;s arrests, humiliations, accusations,
and sentences only make us search well our own past, and that will make
us ever humbler and ever humbler men ourselves; ever more penitent men,
and ever more prayerful men.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; And then Miss Humble-mind, his only daughter, was a servant-maid.&nbsp;
There is no office so humble but that a humble mind will not put on
still more humility in it.&nbsp; What a lesson in humility, not Peter
only got that night in the upper room, but that happy servant-maid also
who brought in the bason and the towel.&nbsp; Would she ever after that
night grumble and give up her place in a passion because she had been
asked to do what was beneath her to do?&nbsp; Would she ever leave that
house for any wages?&nbsp; Would she ever see that bason without kissing
it?&nbsp; Would that towel not be a holy thing ever after in her proud
eyes?&nbsp; How happy that house would ever after that night be, not
so much because the Lord&rsquo;s Supper had been instituted in it, as
because a servant was in it who had learned humility as she went about
the house that night.&nbsp; Let all our servants hold up their heads
and magnify their office.&nbsp; Their Master was once a servant, and
He left us all, and all servants especially, an example that they should
follow in His steps.&nbsp; Peter, whose feet were washed that night,
never forgot that night, and his warm heart always warmed to a servant
when he saw her with her bason and her towels, till he gave her half
a chapter to herself in his splendid First Epistle.&nbsp; &lsquo;Servants,
be subject,&rsquo; he said, till his argument rose to a height above
which not even Paul himself ever rose.&nbsp; Servant-maids, you must
all have your own half-chapter out of First Peter by heart.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; But I have as many students of one kind or other here to-night
as I have maid-servants, and they will remember where a great student
has said that knowledge without love but puffeth a student up.&nbsp;
Now, the best knowledge for us all, and especially so for a student,
is to know himself: his own ignorance, his own foolishness, his blindness
of mind, and, especially, his corruption of heart.&nbsp; For that knowledge
will both keep him from being puffed up with what he already knows,
and it will also put him and keep him in the way of knowing more.&nbsp;
Self-knowledge will increase humility, and all the past masters both
of science and of religion will tell him that humility is the certain
note of the true student.&nbsp; You who are students all know <i>The
Advancement of Learning</i>, just as the servants sitting beside you
all know the second chapter of First Peter.&nbsp; Well, your master
Verulam there tells you, and indeed on every page of his, that it is
only to a humble, waiting, childlike temper that nature, like grace,
will ever reveal up her secrets.&nbsp; &lsquo;There is small chance
of truth at the goal when there is not a childlike humility at the starting-post.&rsquo;&nbsp;
Well, then, all you students who would fain get to the goal of science,
make the Church of Christ your starting-post.&nbsp; Come first and come
continually to the Christian school to learn humility, and then, as
long as your talents, your years, and your opportunities hold out, both
truth and goodness will open up to you at every step.&nbsp; Every step
will be a goal, and at every goal a new step will open up.&nbsp; And
God&rsquo;s smile and God&rsquo;s blessing, and all good men&rsquo;s
love and honour and applause will support and reward you in your race.&nbsp;
And, humble-minded to the truth herself, be, at the same time, humble-minded
toward all who like yourself are seeking to know and to do the truth.&nbsp;
A lately deceased student of nature was a pattern to all students as
long as he waited on truth in his laboratory; and even as long as he
remained at his desk to tell the world what he and other students had
discovered in their search.&nbsp; But when any other student in his
search after truth was compelled to cross that hitherto so exemplary
student, he immediately became as insolent as if he had been the greatest
boor in the country.&nbsp; Till, as he spat out scorn at all who differed
from him we always remembered this in &Agrave; Kempis&mdash;&lsquo;Surely,
an humble husbandman that serveth God is better than a proud philosopher
that, neglecting himself, laboureth to understand the course of the
heavens.&nbsp; It is great wisdom and perfection to esteem nothing of
ourselves, and to think always well and highly of others.&rsquo;&nbsp;
Students of arts, students of philosophy, students of law, students
of medicine, and especially, students of divinity, be humble men.&nbsp;
Labour in humility even more than in your special science.&nbsp; Humility
will advance you in your special science; while, all the time, and at
the end of time, she will be more to you than all the other sciences
taken together.&nbsp; And since I have spoken of &Agrave; Kempis, take
this motto for all your life out of &Agrave; Kempis, as the great and
good F&eacute;nelon did, and it will guide you to the goal: <i>Ama nescia
et pro nihilo reputari</i>.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; But of all the men in the whole world it is ministers who
should simply, as Peter says, be clothed with humility, and that from
head to foot.&nbsp; And, first as divinity students, and then as pastors
and preachers, we who are ministers have advantages and opportunities
in this respect quite peculiar and private to ourselves.&nbsp; For,
while other students are spending their days and their nights on the
ancient classics of Greece and Rome, the student who is to be a minister
is buried in the Psalms, in the Gospels, and in the Epistles.&nbsp;
While the student of law is deep in his commentaries and his cases,
the student of divinity is deep in the study of experimental religion.&nbsp;
And while the medical student is full of the diseases of animals and
of men, the theological student is absorbed in the holiness of the divine
nature, and in the plague of the human heart, and, especially, he is
drowned deeper every day in his own.&nbsp; And he who has begun a curriculum
like that and is not already putting on a humility beyond all other
men had better lose no more time, but turn himself at once to some other
way of making his bread.&nbsp; The word of God and his own heart,&mdash;yes;
what a sure school of evangelical humility to every evangelically-minded
student is that!&nbsp; And, then, after that, and all his days, his
congregational communion-roll and his visiting-book.&nbsp; Let no minister
who would be found of God clothed and canopied over with humility ever
lose sight of his communion-roll and pastoral visitation-book.&nbsp;
I defy any minister to keep those records always open before him and
yet remain a proud man, a self-respecting, self-satisfied, self-righteous
man.&nbsp; For, what secret histories of his own folly, neglect, rashness,
offensiveness, hot-headedness, self-seeking, self-pleasing vanity, now
puffed up over one man, now cast down and full of gloom over another,
what self-flattery here, and what resentment and retaliation there;
and so on, as only his own eyes and his Divine Master&rsquo;s eye can
read between every diary line.&nbsp; What shame will cover that minister
as with a mantle when he thinks what the Christian ministry might be
made, and then takes home to himself what he has made it!&nbsp; Let
any minister shut himself in with his communion-roll and his visiting-book
before each returning communion season, and there will be one worthy
communicant at least in the congregation: one who will have little appetite
all that week for any other food but the broken Body and the shed Blood
of his Redeemer.&nbsp; But these are professional matters that the outside
world has nothing to do with and would not understand.&nbsp; Only, let
all young men who would have evangelical humility absolutely secured
and sealed to them,&mdash;let them come and be ministers.&nbsp; Just
as all young men who would have any satisfaction in life, any sense
of work well done and worthy of reward, any taste of a goal attained
and an old age earned, let them take to anything in all this world but
the evangelical pulpit and its accompanying pastorate.</p>
<p>5.&nbsp; But humility is not a grace of the pulpit and the pastorate
only.&nbsp; It is not those who are separated by the Holy Ghost to study
the word of God and their own hearts all their life long only, who are
called to put on humility.&nbsp; All men are called to that grace.&nbsp;
There is no acceptance with God for any man without that grace.&nbsp;
There is no approach to God for any man without it.&nbsp; All salvation
begins and ends in it.&nbsp; Would you, then, fain possess it?&nbsp;
Would you, then, fain attain to it?&nbsp; Then let there be no mystery
and no mistake made about it.&nbsp; Would any man here fain get down
to that deep valley where God&rsquo;s saints walk in the sweet shade
and lie down in green pastures?&nbsp; Well, I warrant him that just
before him, and already under his eye, there is a flight of steps cut
in the hill, which steps, if he will take them, will, step after step,
take him also down to that bottom.&nbsp; The whole face of this steep
and slippery world is sculptured deep with such submissive steps.&nbsp;
Indeed, when a man&rsquo;s eyes are once turned down to that valley,
there is nothing to be seen anywhere in all this world but downward
steps.&nbsp; Look whichever way you will, there gleams out upon you
yet another descending stair.&nbsp; Look back at the way you came up.&nbsp;
But take care lest the sight turns you dizzy.&nbsp; Look at any spot
you once crossed on your way up, and, lo! every foot-print of yours
has become a descending step.&nbsp; You sink down as you look, broken
down with shame and with horror and with remorse.&nbsp; There are people,
some still left in this world, and some gone to the other world, people
whom you dare not think of lest you should turn sick and lose hold and
hope.&nbsp; There are places you dare not visit: there are scenes you
dare not recall.&nbsp; Lucifer himself would be a humble angel with
his wings over his face if he had a past like yours, and would often
enough return to look at it.&nbsp; And, then, not the past only, but
at this present moment there are people and things placed close beside
you, and kept close beside you, and you close beside them, on divine
purpose just to give you continual occasion and offered opportunity
to practise humility.&nbsp; They are kept close beside you just on purpose
to humiliate you, to cut out your descending steps, to lend you their
hand, and to say to you: Keep near us.&nbsp; Only keep your eye on us,
and we will see you down!&nbsp; And then, if you are resolute enough
to look within, if you are able to keep your eye on what goes on in
your own heart like heart&mdash;beats, then, already, I know where you
are.&nbsp; You are under all men&rsquo;s feet.&nbsp; You are ashamed
to lift up your eyes to meet other men&rsquo;s eyes.&nbsp; You dare
not take their honest hands.&nbsp; You could tell Edwards himself things
about humiliation now that would make his terribly searching and humbling
book quite tame and tasteless.</p>
<p>Come, then, O high-minded man, be sane, be wise.&nbsp; If you were
up on a giddy height, and began to see that certain death was straight
and soon before you, what would you do?&nbsp; You know what you would
do.&nbsp; You would look with all your eyes for such steps as would
take you safest down to the solid ground.&nbsp; You would welcome any
hand stretched out to help you.&nbsp; You would be most attentive and
most obedient and most thankful to any one who would assure you that
this is the right way down.&nbsp; And you would keep on saying to yourself&mdash;Once
I were well down, no man shall see me up here again.&nbsp; Well, my
brethren, humiliation, humility, is to be learned just in the same way,
and it is to be learned in no other way.&nbsp; He who would be down
must just come down.&nbsp; That is all.&nbsp; A step down, and another
step down, and another, and another, and already you are well down.&nbsp;
A humble act done to-day, a humble word spoken to-morrow; humiliation
after humiliation accepted every day that you would at one time have
spurned from you with passion; and then your own vile, hateful, unbearable
heart-all that is ordained of God to bring you down, down to the dust;
and this last, your own heart, will bring you down to the very depths
of hell.&nbsp; And thus, after all your other opportunities and ordinances
of humility are embraced and exhausted, then the plunges, the depths,
the abysses of humility that God will open up in your own heart will
all work in you a meetness for heaven and a ripeness for its glory,
that shall for ever reward you for all that degradation and shame and
self-despair which have been to you the sure way and the only way to
everlasting life.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXI&mdash;MASTER THINK-WELL, THE LATE AND ONLY SON OF OLD
MR. MEDITATION</h2>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;As he thinketh in his heart, so is he.&rsquo;&mdash;<i>A
Proverb</i>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It was a truly delightful sight to see old Mr. Meditation and his
only son, our little Think-well, out among the woods and hedgerows of
a summer afternoon.&nbsp; Little Think-well was the son of his father&rsquo;s
old age.&nbsp; That dry tree used to say to himself that if ever he
was intrusted with a son of his own, he would make his son his most
constant and his most confidential companion all his days.&nbsp; And
so he did.&nbsp; The eleventh of Deuteronomy had become a greater and
greater text to that childless man as he passed the mid-time of his
days.&nbsp; &lsquo;Therefore,&rsquo; he used to say to himself, as he
walked abroad alone, and as other men passed him with their children
at their side&mdash;&lsquo;Therefore ye shall teach them to your children,
speaking of them when thou sittest in thine house, and when thou walkest
by the way, when thou liest down and when thou risest up.&nbsp; And
thou shalt write them upon the doorposts of thine house and upon thy
gates.&rsquo;&nbsp; And thus it was that, as the little lad grew up,
there was no day of all the seven that he so much numbered and waited
for as was that sacred day on which his father was free to take little
Think-well by the hand and lead him out to talk to him.&nbsp; &lsquo;No,&rsquo;
said an Edinburgh boy to his mother the other day&mdash;&lsquo;No, mother,&rsquo;
he said, &lsquo;I have no liking for these Sunday papers with their
poor stories and their pictures.&nbsp; I am to read the Bible stories
and the Bible biographies first.&rsquo;&nbsp; He is not my boy.&nbsp;
I wish my boys were all like him.&nbsp; &lsquo;And Plutarch on week-days
for such a boy,&rsquo; I said to his mother.&nbsp; How to keep a decent
shred of the old sanctification on the modern Sabbath-day is the anxious
inquiry of many fathers and mothers among us.&nbsp; My friend with her
manly-minded boy, and Mr. Meditation with little Think-well had no trouble
in that matter.</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;And once I
said,<br />
As I remember, looking round upon those rocks<br />
And hills on which we all of us were born,<br />
That God who made the Great Book of the world<br />
Would bless such piety;&mdash;<br />
Never did worthier lads break English bread:<br />
The finest Sunday that the autumn saw,<br />
With all its mealy clusters of ripe nuts,<br />
Could never keep those boys away from church,<br />
Or tempt them to an hour of Sabbath breach,<br />
Leonard and James!&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Think-well and that mother&rsquo;s son.</p>
<p>Old Mr. Meditation, the father, was sprung of a poor but honest and
industrious stock in the city.&nbsp; He had not had many talents or
opportunities to begin with, but he had made the very best of the two
he had.&nbsp; And then, when the two estates of Mr. Fritter-day and
Mr. Let-good-slip were sequestered to the crown, the advisers of the
crown handed over those two neglected estates to Mr. Meditation to improve
them for the common good, and after him to his son, whose name we know.&nbsp;
The steps of a good man are ordered of the Lord, and He delighteth in
his way.&nbsp; I have been young and now am old; yet have I not seen
the righteous forsaken, nor his seed begging bread.</p>
<p>Now, this Think-well old Mr. Meditation had by Mrs. Piety, and she
was the daughter of the old Recorder.&nbsp;&nbsp; &lsquo;I am Thy servant,&rsquo;
said Mrs. Piety&rsquo;s son on occasion all his days&mdash;&lsquo;I
am Thy servant and the son of Thine handmaid.&rsquo;&nbsp; And at that
so dutiful acknowledgment of his a long procession of the servants of
God pass up before our eyes with their sainted mothers leaning on the
arms of their great sons.&nbsp; The Psalmist and his mother, the Baptist
and his mother, our Lord and His mother, the author of the Fourth Gospel
and his mother, Paul&rsquo;s son and successor in the gospel and his
mother and grandmother, the author of <i>The Confessions</i> and his
mother; and, in this noble connection, I always think of Halyburton
and his good mother.&nbsp; And in this ennobling connection you will
all think of your own mother also, and before we go any further you
will all say, I also, O Lord, am Thy servant and the son of Thine handmaid.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Fathers and mothers handle children differently,&rsquo; says
Jeremy Taylor.&nbsp; And then that princely teacher of the Church of
Christ Catholic goes on to tell us how Mrs. Piety handled her little
Think-well which she had borne to Mr. Meditation.&nbsp; After other
things, she said this every night before she took sleep to her tired
eyelids, this: &lsquo;Oh give me grace to bring him up.&nbsp; Oh may
I always instruct him with diligence and meekness; govern him with prudence
and holiness; lead him in the paths of religion and justice; never provoking
him to wrath, never indulging him in folly, and never conniving at an
unworthy action.&nbsp; Oh sanctify him in his body, soul, and spirit.&nbsp;
Let all his thoughts be pure and holy to the Searcher of hearts; let
his words be true and prudent before men; and may he have the portion
of the meek and the humble in the world to come, and all through Jesus
Christ our Lord!&rsquo;&nbsp; How could a son get past a father and
a mother like that?&nbsp; Even if, for a season, he had got past them,
he would be sure to come back.&nbsp; Only, their young Think-well never
did get past his father and his mother.</p>
<p>There was not so much word of heredity in his day; but without so
much of the word young Think-well had the whole of the thing.&nbsp;
And as time went on, and the child became more and more the father of
the man, it was seen and spoken of by all the neighbours who knew the
house, how that their only child had inherited all his father&rsquo;s
head, and all his mother&rsquo;s heart, and then that he had reverted
to his maternal grandfather in his so keen and quick sense of right
and wrong.&nbsp; All which, under whatever name it was held, was a most
excellent outfit for our young gentleman.&nbsp; His old father, good
natural head and all, had next to no book-learning.&nbsp; He had only
two or three books that he read a hundred times over till he had them
by heart.&nbsp; And as he sighed over his unlettered lot he always consoled
himself with a saying he had once got out of one of his old books.&nbsp;
The saying of some great authority was to this effect, that &lsquo;an
old and simple woman, if she loves Jesus, may be greater than our great
brother Bonaventure.&rsquo;&nbsp; He did not know who Bonaventure was,
but he always got a reproof again out of his name.&nbsp; Think-well,
to his father&rsquo;s immense delight, was a very methodical little
fellow, and his father and he had orderly little secrets that they told
to none.&nbsp; Little secret plans as to what they were to read about,
and think about, and pray about on certain days of the week and at certain
hours of the day and the night.&nbsp; You must not call the father an
old pedant, for the fact is, it was the son who was the pedant if there
was one in that happy house.&nbsp; The two intimate friends had a word
between them they called <i>agenda</i>.&nbsp; And nobody but themselves
knew where they had borrowed that uncouth word, what language it was,
or what it meant.&nbsp; Only in the old man&rsquo;s tattered pocket-book
there were things like this found by his minister after his death.&nbsp;
Indeed, in a museum of such relics this is still to be read under a
glass case, and in old Mr. Meditation&rsquo;s ramshackle hand: &lsquo;Monday,
death; Tuesday, judgment; Wednesday, heaven; Thursday, hell; Friday,
my past life back to my youth; Saturday, the passion of my Saviour;
Lord&rsquo;s day, creation, salvation, and my own.&mdash;M.&rsquo;&nbsp;
And then, on an utterly illegible page, this: &lsquo;Jesus, Thy life
and Thy words are a perpetual sermon to me.&nbsp; I meditate on Thee
all the day.&nbsp; Make my memory a vessel of election.&nbsp; Let all
my thoughts be plain, honest, pious, simple, prudent, and charitable,
till Thou art pleased to draw the curtain and let me see Thyself, O
Eternal Jesu!&rsquo;&nbsp; If I had time I could tell you more about
Think-well&rsquo;s quaint old father.&nbsp; But the above may be better
than nothing about the rare old gentleman.</p>
<p>A great authority has said&mdash;two great authorities have said
in their enigmatic way, that a &lsquo;dry light is ever the best.&rsquo;&nbsp;
That may be so in some cases and to some uses, but nothing can be more
sure than this, that the light that little Think-well got from his father&rsquo;s
head was excellently drenched in his mother&rsquo;s heart.&nbsp; The
sweet moisture of his mother&rsquo;s heart mixed up beautifully with
his father&rsquo;s drier head and made a fine combination in their one
boy as it turned out.&nbsp; Her minister, preaching on one occasion
on my text for to-night, had said&mdash;and she had such a memory for
a sermon that she had never forgotten it, but had laid it up in her
heart on the spot&mdash;&lsquo;As the philosopher&rsquo;s stone,&rsquo;
the old-fashioned preacher had said, &lsquo;turns all metals into gold,
as the bee sucks honey out of every flower, and as the good stomach
sucks out some sweet and wholesome nourishment out of whatever it takes
into itself, so doth a holy heart, so far as sanctified, convert and
digest all things into spiritual and useful thoughts.&nbsp; This you
may see in Psalm cvii. 43.&rsquo;&nbsp; And in her plain, silent, hidden,
motherly way Mistress Piety adorned her old minister&rsquo;s doctrine
of the holy heart that he was always preaching about, till she shared
her soft and holy heart with her son, as his father had shared his clear
and deep, if too unlearned, head.</p>
<p>We have one grandmother at least signalised in the Bible; but no
grandfather, so far as I remember.&nbsp; But amends are made for that
in the <i>Holy War</i>.&nbsp; For Think-well would never have been the
man he became had it not been for the old Recorder, his grandfather
on his mother&rsquo;s side.&nbsp; Some superficial people said that
there was too much severity in the old Recorder; but his grandson who
knew him best, never said that.&nbsp; He was the best of men, his grandson
used to stand up for him, and say, I shall never forget the debt I owe
him.&nbsp; It was he who taught me first to make conscience of my thoughts.&nbsp;
Indeed, as for my secret thoughts, I had taken no notice of them till
that summer afternoon walk home from church, when we sat down among
the bushes and he showed me on the spot the way.&nbsp; And I can say
to his memory that scarce for one waking hour have I any day forgotten
the lesson.&nbsp; The lesson how to make a conscience, as he said, of
all my thoughts about myself and about all my neighbours.&nbsp; Such,
then, were Think-well&rsquo;s more immediate ancestors, and such was
the inheritance that they all taken together had left him.</p>
<p>Think-well!&nbsp; Think-well!&nbsp; My brethren, what do you think,
what do you say, as you hear that fine name?&nbsp; I will tell you what
I think and say.&nbsp; If I overcome, and have that white stone given
to me, and in that stone a new name written which no man shall know
saving he that receiveth it; and if it were asked me here to-night what
I would like my new name to be, I would say on the spot, Let it be THINK-WELL!&nbsp;
Let my new name among the saved and the sanctified before the throne
be THINK-WELL!&nbsp; As, O God, it will be the bottomless pit to me,
if I am forsaken of Thee for ever to my evil thoughts.&nbsp; Send down
and prevent it.&nbsp; Stir up all Thy strength and give commandment
to prevent it.&nbsp; Do Thou prevent it.&nbsp; For, after I have done
all,&mdash;after I have made all my overt acts blameless, after I have
tamed my tongue which no man can tame&mdash;all that only the more throws
my thoughts into a very devil&rsquo;s garden, a thicket of hell, a secret
swamp of sin to the uttermost.&nbsp; How, then, am I ever to attain
to that white stone and that shining name?&nbsp; And that in a world
of such truth that every man&rsquo;s name and title there shall be a
strict and true and entirely accurate and adequate description and exposition
of the very thoughts and intents and imaginations of his heart?&nbsp;
How shall I, how shall you, my brethren, ever have &lsquo;Think-well&rsquo;
written on our forehead?&mdash;Well, with God all things are possible.&nbsp;
With God, with a much meditating mind, and a true and humble and tender
heart, and a pure conscience, a conscience void of offence, working
together with Him&mdash;He, with all these inheritances and all these
environments working together with Him, will at last enable us, you
and me, to lift up such a clear and transparent forehead.&nbsp; But
not without our constant working together.&nbsp; We must ourselves make
head, and heart, and, especially, conscience of all our thoughts&mdash;for
a long lifetime we must do that.&nbsp; The <i>Ductor Dubitantium</i>
has a deep chapter on &lsquo;The Thinking Conscience.&rsquo;&nbsp; And
what a reproof to many of us lies in the mere name!&nbsp; For how much
evil-thinking and evil-speaking we have all been guilty of through our
unthinking conscience and through a zeal for God, but a zeal without
knowledge.&nbsp; Look back at the history of the Church and see; look
back at your own history in the Church and see.&nbsp; Yes, make conscience
of your thoughts: but let it first be an instructed conscience, a thinking
conscience, a conscience full of the best and the clearest light.&nbsp;
And then let us also make ourselves a new heart and a new spirit, as
Ezekiel has it.&nbsp; For our hearts are continually perverting and
polluting and poisoning our thoughts.&nbsp; That is a fearful thing
that is said about the men on whom the flood soon came.&nbsp; You remember
what is said about them, and in explanation and justification of the
flood.&nbsp; God saw, it is said, that every imagination of the thoughts
of their hearts was evil, and only evil continually.&nbsp; Fearful!&nbsp;
Far more fearful than ten floods!&nbsp; O God, Thou seest us.&nbsp;
And Thou seest all the imaginations of the thoughts of our hearts.&nbsp;
Oh give us all a mind and a heart and a conscience to think of nothing,
to fear nothing, to watch and to pray about nothing compared with our
thoughts.&nbsp; &lsquo;As for my secret thoughts,&rsquo; says the author
of the <i>Holy War</i> and the creator of Master Think-well&mdash;&lsquo;As
for my secret thoughts, I paid no attention to them.&nbsp; I never knew
I had them.&nbsp; I had no pain, or shame, or guilt, or horror, or despair
on account of them till John Gifford took me and showed me the way.&rsquo;&nbsp;
And then when John Bunyan, being the man of genius he was,&mdash;as
soon as he began to attend to his own secret thoughts, then the first
faint outline of this fine portrait of Think-well began to shine out
on the screen of this great artist&rsquo;s imagination, and from that
sanctified screen this fine portrait of Think-well and his family has
shined into our hearts to-night.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXII&mdash;MR. GOD&rsquo;S-PEACE, A GOODLY PERSON, AND A
SWEET-NATURED GENTLEMAN</h2>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Let the peace of God rule in your hearts,&mdash;the
peace of God that passeth all understanding.&rsquo;&mdash;<i>Paul</i>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>John Bunyan is always at his very best in allegory.&nbsp; In some
other departments of work John Bunyan has had many superiors; but when
he lays down his head on his hand and begins to dream, as we see him
in some of the old woodcuts, then he is alone; there is no one near
him.&nbsp; We have not a few greater divines in pure divinity than John
Bunyan.&nbsp; We have some far better expositors of Scripture than John
Bunyan, and we have some far better preachers.&nbsp; John Bunyan at
his best cannot open up a deep Scripture like that prince of expositors,
Thomas Goodwin.&nbsp; John Bunyan in all his books has nothing to compare
for intellectual strength and for theological grasp with Goodwin&rsquo;s
chapter on the peace of God, in his sixth book in <i>The Work of the
Holy Ghost</i>.&nbsp; John Bunyan cannot set forth divine truth in an
orderly method and in a built-up body like John Owen.&nbsp; He cannot
Platonize divine truth like his Puritan contemporary, John Howe.&nbsp;
He cannot soar high as heaven in the beauty and the sweetness of gospel
holiness like Jonathan Edwards.&nbsp; He has nothing of the philosophical
depth of Richard Hooker, and he has nothing of the vast learning of
Jeremy Taylor.&nbsp; But when John Bunyan&rsquo;s mind and heart begin
to work through his imagination, then&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;His language is not ours.<br />
&rsquo;Tis my belief God speaks; no tinker hath such powers.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>1.&nbsp; In the beginning of his chapter on &lsquo;Speaking peace,&rsquo;
Thomas Goodwin tells his reader that he is going to fully couch all
his intendments under a metaphor and an allegory.&nbsp; But Goodwin&rsquo;s
reader has read and re-read the great chapter, and has not yet discovered
where the metaphor and the allegory came in and where they went out.&nbsp;
But Bunyan does not need to advertise his reader that he is going to
couch his teaching in his imagination.</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;But having now my method by the end,<br />
Still, as I pulled it came: and so I penned<br />
It down; until at last it came to be<br />
For length and breadth the bigness that you see.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Blessed Prince, he begins, did also ordain a new officer in the
town, and a goodly person he was.&nbsp; His name was Mr. God&rsquo;s-peace.&nbsp;
This man was set over my Lord Will-be-will, my Lord Mayor, Mr. Recorder,
the subordinate preacher, Mr. Mind, and over all the natives of the
town of Mansoul.&nbsp; Himself was not a native of the town, but came
with the Prince from the court above.&nbsp; He was a great acquaintance
of Captain Credence and Captain Good-hope; some say they were kin, and
I am of that opinion too.&nbsp; This man, as I said, was made governor
of the town in general, especially over the castle, and Captain Credence
was to help him there.&nbsp; And I made great observation of it, that
so long as all things went in the town as this sweet-natured gentleman
would have them go, the town was in a most happy condition.&nbsp; Now
there were no jars, no chiding, no interferings, no unfaithful doings
in all the town; every man in Mansoul kept close to his own employment.&nbsp;
The gentry, the officers, the soldiers, and all in place, observed their
order.&nbsp; And as for the women and the children of the town, they
followed their business joyfully.&nbsp; They would work and sing, work
and sing, from morning till night; so that quite through the town of
Mansoul now nothing was to be found but harmony, quietness, joy, and
health.&nbsp; And this lasted all the summer.&nbsp; I shall step aside
at this point and shall let Jonathan Edwards comment on this sweet-natured
gentleman and his heavenly name.&nbsp; &lsquo;God&rsquo;s peace has
an exquisite sweetness,&rsquo; says Edwards.&nbsp; &lsquo;It is exquisitely
sweet because it has so firm a foundation on the everlasting rock.&nbsp;
It is sweet also because it is so perfectly agreeable to reason.&nbsp;
It is sweet also because it riseth from holy and divine principles,
which, as they are the virtue, so are they the proper happiness of man.&nbsp;
This peace is exquisitely sweet also because of the greatness of the
good that the saints enjoy, being no other than the infinite bounty
and fulness of that God who is the Fountain of all good.&nbsp; It is
sweet also because it shall be enjoyed to perfection hereafter.&rsquo;&nbsp;
An enthusiastic student has counted up the number of times that this
divine word &lsquo;sweetness&rsquo; occurs in Edwards, and has proved
that no other word of the kind occurs so often in the author of <i>True
Virtue</i> and <i>The Religious Affections</i>.&nbsp; And I can well
believe it; unless the &lsquo;beauty of holiness&rsquo; runs it close.&nbsp;
Still, this sweet-natured gentleman will continue to live for us in
his government and jurisdiction in Mansoul and in John Bunyan even more
than in Jonathan Edwards.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; &lsquo;Now Mr. God&rsquo;s-peace, the new Governor of Mansoul,
was not a native of the town; he came down with his Prince from the
court above.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;He was not a native&rsquo;&mdash;let
that attribute of his be written in letters of gold on every gate and
door and wall within his jurisdiction.&nbsp; When you need the governor
and would seek him at any time or in any place in all the town and cannot
find him, recollect yourself where he came from: he may have returned
thither again.&nbsp; John Bunyan has couched his deepest instruction
to you in that single sentence in which he says, &lsquo;Mr. God&rsquo;s-peace
was not a native of the town.&rsquo;&nbsp; John Bunyan has gathered
up many gospel Scriptures into that single allegorical sentence.&nbsp;
He has made many old and familiar passages fresh and full of life again
in that one metaphorical sentence.&nbsp; It is the work of genius to
set forth the wont and the well known in a clear, simple, and at the
same time surprising, light like that.&nbsp; There is a peace that is
native and natural to the town of Mansoul, and to understand that peace,
its nature, its grounds, its extent, and its range, is most important
to the theologian and to the saint.&nbsp; But to understand the peace
of God, that supreme peace, the peace that passeth all understanding,&mdash;that
is the highest triumph of the theologian and the highest wisdom of the
saint.&nbsp; The prophets and the psalmists of the Old Testament are
all full of the peace that God gave to His people Israel.&nbsp; My peace
I give unto you, says our Lord also.&nbsp; Paul also has taken up that
peace that comes to us through the blood of Christ, and has made it
his grand message to us and to all sinful and sin-disquieted men.&nbsp;
And John Bunyan has shown how sure and true a successor of the apostles
of Christ he is, just in his portrait of this sweet-natured gentleman
who was not a native of Mansoul, but who came from that same court from
which Emmanuel Himself came.&nbsp; And it is just this outlandishness
of this sweet-natured gentleman; it is just this heavenly origin and
divine extraction of his that makes him sometimes and in some things
to surpass all earthly understanding.&nbsp; &lsquo;I am coming some
day soon,&rsquo; said a divinity student to me the other Sabbath night,
&lsquo;to have you explain and clear up the atonement to me.&rsquo;&nbsp;
&lsquo;I shall be glad to see you,&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;but not on
that errand.&rsquo;&nbsp; No.&nbsp; Paul himself could not do it.&nbsp;
Paul said that the atonement and the peace of it passed all his understanding.&nbsp;
And John Bunyan says here that not the Prince only, but his officer
Mr. God&rsquo;s-peace also, was not native to the town of Mansoul, but
came straight down from heaven into that town&mdash;and what can the
man do who cometh after two kings like Paul and Bunyan?&nbsp; I have
not forgotten my Edwards where he says that the exquisite sweetness
of this peace is perfectly agreeable to reason.&nbsp; As, indeed, so
it is.&nbsp; And yet, if reason will have a clear and finished and all-round
answer to all her difficulties and objections and fault-findings, I
fear she cannot have it here.&nbsp; The time may come when our reason
also shall be so enlarged, and so sanctified, and so exalted, that she
shall be able with all saints to see the full mystery of that which
in this present dispensation passeth all understanding.&nbsp; But till
then, only let God&rsquo;s peace enter our hearts with God&rsquo;s Son,
and then let our hearts say if that peace must not in some high and
deep way be according to the highest and the deepest reason, since its
coming into our hearts has produced in our hearts and in our lives such
reasonable, and right, and harmonious, and peaceful, and every way joyful
results.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; Governor God&rsquo;s-peace had not many in the town of Mansoul
to whom he could confide all his thoughts and with whom he could consult.&nbsp;
But there were two officer friends of his stationed in the town with
whom he was every day in close correspondence, viz., the Captain Credence
and the Captain Good-hope.&nbsp; Their so close intimacy will not be
wondered at when it is known that those three officers had all come
in together with Emmanuel the Conqueror.&nbsp; Those three young captains
had done splendid service, each at the head of his own battalion, in
the days of the invasion and the conquest of Mansoul, and they had all
had their present titles, and privileges, and lands, and offices, patented
to them on the strength of their past services.&nbsp; The Captain Credence
had all along been the confidential aide-de-camp and secretary of the
Prince.&nbsp; Indeed, the Prince never called Captain Credence a servant
at all, but always a friend.&nbsp; The Prince had always conveyed his
mind about all Mansoul&rsquo;s matters first to Captain Credence, and
then that confidential captain conveyed whatever specially concerned
God&rsquo;s-peace and Good-hope to those excellent and trusty soldiers.&nbsp;
Credence first told all matters to God&rsquo;s-peace and then the two
soon talked over Good-hope to their mind and heart.&nbsp; Some say that
the three officers, Credence, God&rsquo;s-peace, and Good-hope, were
kin, adds our historian, and I, he adds, am of that opinion too.&nbsp;
And to back up his opinion he takes an extract out of the Herald&rsquo;s
College books which runs thus: &lsquo;Romans, fifteenth and thirteenth:
Now, the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing, that
ye may abound in hope, through the power of the Holy Ghost.&rsquo;&nbsp;
Some say the three officers were of kin, and I am of that opinion too.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; On account both of his eminent services and his great abilities,
the Prince saw it good to set Mr. God&rsquo;s-peace over the whole town.&nbsp;
And thus it was that the governor&rsquo;s jurisdiction extended and
held not only over the people of the town, but also over all the magistrates
and all the other officers of the town, such as my Lord Will-be-will,
my Lord Mayor, Mr. Recorder, Mr. Mind, and all.&nbsp; It needed all
the governor&rsquo;s authority and ability to keep his feet in his office
over all the other rulers of the town, but by far his greatest trouble
always was with the Recorder.&nbsp; Old Mr. Conscience, the Town Recorder,
had a very difficult post to hold and a very difficult part to play
in that still so divided and still so unsettled town.&nbsp; What with
all those murderers and man-slayers, thieves and prostitutes, skulkers
and secret rebels, on the one hand, and with Governor God&rsquo;s-peace
and his so unaccountable and so autocratic ways, on the other hand,
the Recorder&rsquo;s office was no sinecure.&nbsp; All the misdemeanours
and malpractices of the town,&mdash;and they were happening every day
and every night,&mdash;were all reported to the Recorder; they were
all, so to say, charged home upon the Recorder, and he was held responsible
for them all; till his office was a perfect laystall and cesspool of
all the scum and corruption of the town.&nbsp; And yet, in would come
Governor God&rsquo;s-peace, without either warning or explanation, and
would demand all the Recorder&rsquo;s papers, and proofs, and affidavits,
and what not, it had cost him so much trouble to get collected and indorsed,
and would burn them all before the Recorder&rsquo;s face, and to his
utter confusion, humiliation, and silence.&nbsp; So autocratic, so despotic,
so absolute, and not-to-be-questioned was Governor God&rsquo;s-peace.&nbsp;
The Recorder could not understand it, and could barely submit to it;
my Lord Mayor could not understand it, and his clerk, Mr. Mind, would
often oppose it; but there it was: Mr. Governor God&rsquo;s-peace was
set over them all.</p>
<p>5.&nbsp; But the thing that always in the long-run justified the
governorship of Mr. God&rsquo;s-peace, and reconciled all the other
officers to his supremacy, was the way that the city settled down and
prospered under his benignant rule.&nbsp; All the other officers admitted
that, somehow, his promotion and power had been the salvation of Mansoul.&nbsp;
They all extolled their Prince&rsquo;s far-seeing wisdom in the selection,
advancement, and absolute seat of Mr. God&rsquo;s-peace.&nbsp; And it
would ill have become them to have said anything else; for they had
little else to do but bask in the sun and enjoy the honours and the
emoluments of their respective offices as long as Governor God&rsquo;s-peace
held sway, and had all things in the city to his own mind.&nbsp; Now,
it was on all hands admitted, as we read again with renewed delight,
that there were no jars, no chiding, no interferings, no unfaithful
doings in the town of Mansoul; but every man kept close to his own employment.&nbsp;
The gentry, the officers, the soldiers, and all in place, observed their
orders.&nbsp; And as for the women and children, they all followed their
business joyfully.&nbsp; They would work and sing, work and sing, from
morning till night, so that quite through the town of Mansoul now nothing
was to be found but harmony, quietness, joy, and health.&nbsp; What
more could be said of any governorship of any town than that?&nbsp;
The Heavenly Court itself, out of which Governor God&rsquo;s-peace had
come down, was not better governed than that.&nbsp; Harmony, quietness,
joy, and health.&nbsp; No; the New Jerusalem itself will not surpass
that.&nbsp; &lsquo;And this lasted all that summer.&rsquo;</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXIII&mdash;THE ESTABLISHED CHURCH OF MANSOUL, AND MR. CONSCIENCE
ONE OF HER PARISH MINISTERS</h2>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;The Highest Himself shall establish her.&rsquo;&mdash;<i>David</i>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The princes of this world establish churches sometimes out of piety
and sometimes out of policy.&nbsp; Sometimes their motive is the good
of their people and the glory of God, and sometimes their sole motive
is to buttress up their own Royal House, and to have a clergy around
them on whom they can count.&nbsp; Prince Emmanuel had His motive, too,
in setting up an establishment in Mansoul.&nbsp; As thus: When this
was over, the Prince sent again for the elders of the town and communed
with them about the ministry that He intended to establish in Mansoul.&nbsp;
Such a ministry as might open to them and might instruct them in the
things that did concern their present and their future state.&nbsp;
For, said He to them, of yourselves, unless you have teachers and guides,
you will not be able to know, and if you do not know, then you cannot
do the will of My Father.&nbsp; At this news, when the elders of Mansoul
brought it to the people, the whole town came running together, and
all with one consent implored His Majesty that He would forthwith establish
such a ministry among them as might teach them both law and judgment,
statute and commandment, so that they might be documented in all good
and wholesome things.&nbsp; So He told them that He would graciously
grant their requests and would straightway establish such a ministry
among them.</p>
<p>Now, I will not enter to-night on the abstract benefits of such an
Establishment.&nbsp; I will rather take one of the ministers who was
presented to one of the parishes of Mansoul, and shall thus let you
see how that State Church worked out practically in one of its ministers
at any rate.&nbsp; And the preacher and pastor I shall so take up was
neither the best minister in the town nor the worst; but, while a long
way subordinate to the best, he was also by no means the least.&nbsp;
The Reverend Mr. Conscience was our parish minister&rsquo;s name; his
people sometimes called him The Recorder.</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; Well, then, to begin with, the Rev. Mr. Conscience was a
native of the same town in which his parish church now stood.&nbsp;
I am not going to challenge the wisdom of the patron who appointed his
prot&eacute;g&eacute; to this particular living; only, I have known
very good ministers who never got over the misfortune of having been
settled in the same town in which they had been born and brought up.&nbsp;
Or, rather, their people never got over it.&nbsp; One excellent minister,
especially, I once knew, whose father had been a working man in the
town, and his son had sometimes assisted his father before he went to
college, and even between his college sessions, and the people he afterwards
came to teach could never get over that.&nbsp; It was not wise in my
friend to accept that presentation in the circumstances, as the event
abundantly proved.&nbsp; For, whenever he had to take his stand in his
pulpit or in his pastorate against any of their evil ways, his people
defended themselves and retaliated on him by reminding him that they
knew his father and his mother, and had not forgotten his own early
days.&nbsp; No doubt, in the case of Emmanuel and Mansoul and its minister,
there were counterbalancing considerations and advantages both to minister
and people; but it is not always so; and it was not so in the case of
my unfortunate friend.</p>
<p>Forasmuch, so ran the Prince&rsquo;s presentation paper, as he is
a native of the town of Mansoul, and thus has personal knowledge of
all the laws and customs of the corporation, therefore he, the Prince,
presented Mr. Conscience.&nbsp; That is to say, every man who is to
be the minister of a parish should make his own heart and his own life
his first parish.&nbsp; His own vineyard should be his first knowledge
and his first care.&nbsp; And then out of that and after that he will
be able to speak to his people, and to correct, and counsel, and take
care of them.&nbsp; In Thomas Boston&rsquo;s <i>Memoirs</i> we continually
come on entries like this: &lsquo;Preached on Ps. xlii. 5, and mostly
on my own account.&rsquo;&nbsp; And, again, we read in the same invaluable
book for parish ministers, that its author did not wonder to hear that
good had been done by last Sabbath&rsquo;s sermon, because he had preached
it to himself and had got good to himself out of it before he took it
to the pulpit.&nbsp; Boston kept his eye on himself in a way that the
minister of Mansoul himself could not have excelled.&nbsp; Till, not
in his pulpit work only, but in such conventional, commonplace, and
monotonous exercises as his family worship, he so read the Scriptures
and so sang the psalms that his family worship was continually yielding
him fruit as well as his public ministry.&nbsp; As our family worship
and our public ministry will do, too, when we have the eye and the heart
and the conscience that Thomas Boston had.&nbsp; &lsquo;I went to hear
a preacher,&rsquo; said Pascal, &lsquo;and I found a man in the pulpit.&rsquo;&nbsp;
Well, the parish minister of Mansoul was a man, and so was the parish
minister of Ettrick.&nbsp; And that was the reason that the people of
Simprin and Ettrick so often thought that Boston had them in his eye.&nbsp;
Good pastor as he was, he could not have everybody in his eye.&nbsp;
But he had himself in his eye, and that let him into the hearts and
the homes of all his people.&nbsp; He was a true man, and thus a true
minister.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; Both Boston and the minister of Mansoul were well-read men
also; so, indeed, in as many words, their fine biographies assure us.&nbsp;
But that is just another way of saying what has been said about those
two ministers over and over again already.&nbsp; William Law never was
a parish minister.&nbsp; The English Crown of that day would not trust
him with a parish.&nbsp; But what was the everlasting loss of some parish
in England has become the everlasting gain of the whole Church of Christ.&nbsp;
Law&rsquo;s enforced seclusion from outward ministerial activity only
set him the more free to that inward activity which has been such a
blessing to so many, and to so many ministers especially.&nbsp; And
as to this of every minister being well read, that master in Israel
says: &lsquo;Above all, let me tell you that the book of books to you
is your own heart, in which are written and engraven the deepest lessons
of divine instruction.&nbsp; Learn, therefore, to be deeply attentive
to the presence of God in your own hearts, who is always speaking, always
instructing, always illuminating the heart that is attentive to Him.&rsquo;&nbsp;
Jonathan Edwards called the poor parish minister of Ettrick &lsquo;a
truly great divine.&rsquo;&nbsp; But Law goes on to say, &lsquo;A great
divine is but a cant expression unless it signifies a man greatly advanced
in the divine life.&nbsp; A great divine is one whose own experience
and example are a demonstration of the reality of all the graces and
virtues of the gospel.&nbsp; No divine has any more of the gospel in
him than that which proves itself by the spirit, the actions, and the
form of his life: the rest is but hypocrisy, not divinity.&rsquo;&nbsp;
Let all our parish ministers, then, give themselves to this kind of
reading.&nbsp; Let them all aim at a doctor&rsquo;s degree in the divinity
of their own hearts.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; We are done at last, and we are done for ever, in Scotland,
with patrons and with presenters; but I daresay our most Free Church
people would be quite willing to surrender their dear-bought franchise
if the old plan could even yet be made to work in all their parishes
as it worked in Mansoul.&nbsp; For not only was the presented minister
in this case a well-read man; he was also, what the best of the Scottish
people have always loved and honoured, a man, as this history testifies,
with a tongue as bravely hung as he had a head filled with judgment.&nbsp;
In Scotland we like our minister to have a tongue bravely hung, even
when that is proved to our own despite.&nbsp; When any minister, parish
minister or other, is seen to tune his pulpit, our respect for him is
gone.&nbsp; The Presbyterian pulpit has been proverbially hard to tune,
and it will be an ill day when it becomes easy.&nbsp; &lsquo;Here lies
a man who had a brow for every good cause.&rsquo;&nbsp; So it was engraven
over one of Boston&rsquo;s elders.&nbsp; And so is it always: like priest,
like people in the matter of the hang of the minister&rsquo;s tongue
and in the boldness of the elder&rsquo;s brow.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Bravely hung&rsquo; is an ancient and excellent expression
which has several shades of meaning in Bunyan.&nbsp; But in the present
instance its meaning is modified and fixed by judgment.&nbsp; A bravely
hung tongue; at the same time the parish minister of Mansoul&rsquo;s
tongue was not a loosely-hung tongue.&nbsp; It was not a blustering,
headlong, scolding, untamed tongue.&nbsp; The pulpit of Mansoul was
tuned with judgment.&nbsp; He who filled that pulpit had a head filled
with judgment.&nbsp; The ground of judgment is knowledge, and the minister
of Mansoul was a man of knowledge.&nbsp; It was his early and ever-increasing
knowledge of himself, and thus of other men; and then it was his excellent
judgment as to the use he was to make of that knowledge; it was his
sound knowledge what to say, when to say it, and how to say it,&mdash;it
was all this that decided his Prince to make him the minister of Mansoul.&nbsp;
How excellent and how rare a gift is judgment&mdash;judgment in counsel,
judgment in speech, and judgment in action!&nbsp; &lsquo;I am very little
serviceable with reference to public management,&rsquo; writes the parish
minister of Ettrick, &lsquo;being exceedingly defective in ecclesiastical
prudence; but the Lord has given me a pulpit gift, not unacceptable:
and who knows what He may do with me in that way?&rsquo;&nbsp; Who knows,
indeed!&nbsp; Now, there are many parish ministers who have a not unacceptable
pulpit gift, and yet who are not content with that, but are always burying
that gift in the earth and running away from it to attempt a public
management in which they are exceedingly and conspicuously defective.&nbsp;
Now, why do they do that?&nbsp; Is their pulpit and their parish not
sphere and opportunity enough for them?&nbsp; Mine is a small parish,
said Boston, but then it is mine.&nbsp; And a small parish may both
rear and occupy a truly great divine.&nbsp; Let those ministers, then,
who are defective in ecclesiastical prudence not be too much cast down.&nbsp;
Ecclesiastical prudence is not in every case the highest kind of prudence.&nbsp;
The presbytery, the synod, and the assembly are not any minister&rsquo;s
first or best sphere.&nbsp; Every minister&rsquo;s first and best sphere
is his parish.&nbsp; And the presbytery is not the end of the parish.&nbsp;
The parish, the pastorate, and the pulpit are the end of both presbytery
and synod and assembly.&nbsp; As for the minister of Mansoul, he was
a well-read man, and also a man of courage to speak out the truth at
every occasion, and he had a tongue as bravely hung as he had a head
filled with judgment.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; But there was one thing about the parish pulpit of Mansoul
that always overpowered the people.&nbsp; They could not always explain
it even to themselves what it was that sometimes so terrified them,
and, sometimes, again, so enthralled them.&nbsp; They would say sometimes
that their minister was more than a mere man; that he was a prophet
and a seer, and that his Master seemed sometimes to stand and speak
again in His servant.&nbsp; And &lsquo;seer&rsquo; was not at all an
inappropriate name for their minister, so far as I can collect out of
some remains of his that I have seen and some testimonies that I have
heard.&nbsp; There was something awful and overawing, something seer-like
and supernatural, in the pulpit of Mansoul.&nbsp; Sometimes the iron
chains in which the preacher climbed up into the pulpit, and in which
he both prayed and preached, struck a chill to every heart; and sometimes
the garment of salvation in which he shone carried all their hearts
captive.&nbsp; Some Sabbath mornings they saw it in his face and heard
it in his voice that he had been on his bed in hell all last night;
and then, next Sabbath, those who came back saw him descending into
his pulpit from his throne in heaven.</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Yea, this man&rsquo;s brow, like to a title-page<br />
Foretells the nature of a tragic volume.<br />
Thou tremblest, and the whiteness in thy cheek<br />
Is apter than thy tongue to tell thine errand.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you think that I am exaggerating and magnifying the parish pulpit
of Mansoul, take this out of the parish records for yourselves.&nbsp;
&lsquo;And now,&rsquo; you will read in one place, &lsquo;it was a day
gloomy and dark, a day of clouds and thick darkness with Mansoul.&nbsp;
Well, when the Sabbath-day was come he took for his text that in the
prophet Jonah, &ldquo;They that observe lying vanities forsake their
own mercy.&rdquo;&nbsp; And then there was such power and authority
in that sermon, and such dejection seen in the countenances of the people
that day that the like had seldom been heard or seen.&nbsp; The people,
when the sermon was done, were scarce able to go to their homes, or
to betake themselves to their employments the whole week after.&nbsp;
They were so sermon-smitten that they knew not what to do.&nbsp; For
not only did their preacher show to Mansoul its sin, but he did tremble
before them under the sense of his own, still crying out as he preached,
Unhappy man that I am! that I, a preacher, should have lived so senselessly
and so sottishly in my parish, and be one of the foremost in its transgressions!&nbsp;
With these things he also charged all the lords and gentry of Mansoul
to the almost distracting of them.&rsquo;&nbsp; It was Sabbaths like
that that made the people of Mansoul call their minister a seer.</p>
<p>5.&nbsp; And, then, there was another thing that I do not know how
better to describe than by calling it the true catholicity, the true
humility, and the true hospitality of the man.&nbsp; It is true he had
no choice in the matter, for in setting up a standing ministry in Mansoul
Emmanuel had done so with this reservation and addition.&nbsp; We have
His very words.&nbsp; &lsquo;Not that you are to have your ministers
alone,&rsquo; He said.&nbsp; &lsquo;For my four captains, they can,
if need be, and if they be required, not only privately inform, but
publicly preach both good and wholesome doctrine, that, if heeded, will
do thee good in the end.&rsquo;&nbsp; Which, again, reminds me of what
Oliver Cromwell wrote to the Honourable Colonel Hacker at Peebles.&nbsp;
&lsquo;These: I was not satisfied with your last speech to me about
Empson, that he was a better preacher than fighter&mdash;or words to
that effect.&nbsp; Truly, I think that he that prays and preaches best
will fight best.&nbsp; I know nothing that will give like courage and
confidence as the knowledge of God in Christ will.&nbsp; I pray you
to receive Captain Empson lovingly.&rsquo;</p>
<p>6.&nbsp; The standing ministry in Mansoul was endowed also; but I
cannot imagine what the court of teinds would make of the instrument
of endowment.&nbsp; As it has been handed down to us, that old ecclesiastical
instrument reads more like a lesson in the parish minister&rsquo;s class
for the study of Mysticism than a writing for a learned lord to adjudicate
upon.&nbsp; Here is the Order of Council: &lsquo;Therefore I, thy Prince,
give thee, My servant, leave and licence to go when thou wilt to My
fountain, My conduit, and there to drink freely of the blood of My grape,
for My conduit doth always run wine.&nbsp; Thus doing, thou shalt drive
from thine heart all foul, gross, and hurtful humours.&nbsp; It will
also lighten thine eyes, and it will strengthen thy memory for the reception
and the keeping of all that My Father&rsquo;s noble secretary will teach
thee.&rsquo;&nbsp; Thus the Prince did put Mr. Conscience into the place
and office of a minister to Mansoul, and the chosen and presented man
did thankfully accept thereof.</p>
<p>(1)&nbsp; Now, there are at least three lessons taught us here.&nbsp;
There is, to begin with, a lesson to all those congregations who are
about to choose a minister.&nbsp; Let all those congregations, then,
who have had devolved on them the powers of the old patrons,&mdash;let
them make their election on the same principles that the Prince of Mansoul
patronised.&nbsp; Let them choose a probationer who, young though he
must be, has the making of a seer in him.&nbsp; Let them listen for
the future seer in his most stammering prayers.&nbsp; Somewhere, even
in one service, his conscience will make itself heard, if he has a conscience.&nbsp;
Rather remain ten years vacant than call a minister who has no conscience.&nbsp;
The parish minister of Mansoul sometimes seemed to be all conscience,
and it was this that made his head so full of judgment, his tongue so
full of a brave boldness, and his heart so full of holy love.&nbsp;
Your minister may be an anointed bishop, he may be a gowned and hooded
doctor, he may be a king&rsquo;s chaplain, he may be the minister of
the largest and the richest and the most learned parish in the city,
but, unless he strikes terror and pain into your conscience every Sabbath,
unless he makes you tremble every Sabbath under the eye and the hand
of God, he is no true minister to you.&nbsp; As Goodwin says, he is
a wooden cannon.&nbsp; As Leighton says, he is a mountebank for a minister.</p>
<p>(2)&nbsp; The second lesson is to all those who are politically enfranchised,
and who hold a vote for a member of Parliament.&nbsp; Now, crowds of
candidates and their canvassers will before long be at your door besieging
it and begging you for your vote for or against an Established church.&nbsp;
Well, before Parliament is dissolved, and the canvass commences, look
you well into your own heart and ask yourself whether or no the Church
of Christ has yet been established there.&nbsp; Ask if Jesus Christ,
the Head of the Church, has yet set up His throne there, in your heart.&nbsp;
Ask your conscience if His laws are recognised and obeyed there.&nbsp;
Ask also if His blood has been sprinkled there, and since when.&nbsp;
And, if not, then it needs no seer to tell you what sacrilege, what
profanity it is for you to touch the ark of God: to speak, or to vote,
or to lift a finger either for or against any church whatsoever.&nbsp;
Intrude your wilful ignorance and your wicked passions anywhere else.&nbsp;
March up boldly and vote defiantly on questions of State that you never
read a sober line about, and are as ignorant about as you are of Hebrew;
but beware of touching by a thousand miles the things for which the
Son of God laid down His life.&nbsp; Thrust yourself in, if you must,
anywhere else, but do not thrust yourself and your brutish stupidity
and your fiendish tempers into the things of the house of God.&nbsp;
Let all parish ministers take for their text that day 2 Samuel vi. 6,
7:&mdash;And when they came to Nachon&rsquo;s threshing-floor, Uzzah
put forth his hand to the ark of God, and took hold of it; for the oxen
shook it.&nbsp; And the anger of the Lord was kindled against Uzzah;
and God smote him there for his error; and there he died by the ark
of God.</p>
<p>(3)&nbsp; There is a third lesson here, but it is a lesson for ministers,
and I shall take it home to myself.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXIV&mdash;A FAST-DAY IN MANSOUL</h2>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Sanctify a fast, call a solemn assembly, gather
the elders and all the inhabitants of the land into the house of the
Lord your God.&rsquo;&mdash;<i>Joel</i>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In our soft and self-indulgent day the very word &lsquo;to fast&rsquo;
has become an out-of-date and an obsolete word.&nbsp; We never have
occasion to employ that word in the living language of the present day.&nbsp;
The men of the next generation will need to have it explained to them
what the Fast-days of their fathers were: when they were instituted,
how they were observed, and why they were abrogated and given up.&nbsp;
If your son should ever ask you just what the Fast-days of your youth
were like, you will do him a great service, and he may live to recover
them, if you will answer him in this way.&nbsp; Show him how to take
his Cruden and how to make a picture to his opening mind of the Fast-days
of Scripture.&nbsp; And tell him plainly for what things in fathers
and in sons those fasts were ordained of God.&nbsp; And then for the
Fast-days of the Puritan period let him read aloud to you this powerful
passage in the <i>Holy War</i>.&nbsp; Public preaching and public prayer
entered largely into the fasting of the Prophetical and the Puritan
periods; and John Bunyan, after Joel, has told us some things about
the Fast-day preaching of his day that it will be well for us, both
preachers and people, to begin with, and to lay well to heart.</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; In the first place, the preaching of that Fast-day was &lsquo;pertinent&rsquo;
and to the point.&nbsp; William Law, that divine writer for ministers,
warns ministers against going off upon Euroclydon and the shipwrecks
of Paul when Christ&rsquo;s sheep are looking up to them for their proper
food.&nbsp; What, he asks, is the nature, the direction, and the strength
of that Mediterranean wind to him who has come up to church under the
plague of his own heart and under the heavy hand of God?&nbsp; You may
be sure that Boanerges did not lecture that Fast-day forenoon in Mansoul
on Acts xxvii. 14.&nbsp; We would know that, even if we were not told
what his text that forenoon was.&nbsp; His text that never-to-be-forgotten
Fast-day forenoon was in Luke xiii. 7&mdash;&lsquo;Cut it down; why
cumbereth it the ground?&rsquo;&nbsp; And a very smart sermon he made
upon the place.&nbsp; First, he showed what was the occasion of the
words, namely, because the fig-tree was barren.&nbsp; Then he showed
what was contained in the sentence, to wit, repentance or utter desolation.&nbsp;
He then showed also by whose authority this sentence was pronounced.&nbsp;
And, lastly, he showed the reasons of the point, and then concluded
his sermon.&nbsp; But he was very pertinent in the application, insomuch
that he made all the elders and all their people in Mansoul to tremble.&nbsp;
Sidney Smith says that whatever else a sermon may be or may not be,
it must be interesting if it is to do any good.&nbsp; Now, pertinent
preaching is always interesting preaching.&nbsp; Nothing interests men
like themselves.&nbsp; And pertinent preaching is just preaching to
men about themselves,&mdash;about their interests, their losses and
their gains, their hopes and their fears, their trials and their tribulations.&nbsp;
Boanerges took both his text and his treatment of his text from his
Master, and we know how pertinently The Master preached.&nbsp; His preaching
was with such pertinence that the one half of His hearers went home
saying, Never man spake like this man, while the other half gnashed
at Him with their teeth.&nbsp; Our Lord never lectured on Euroclydon.&nbsp;
He knew what was in man and He lectured and preached accordingly.&nbsp;
And if we wish to have praise of our best people, and of Him whose people
they are, let us look into our own hearts and preach.&nbsp; That will
be pertinent to our people which is first pertinent to ourselves.&nbsp;
Weep yourself, said an old poet to a new beginner; weep yourself if
you would make me weep.&nbsp; &lsquo;For my own part,&rsquo; said Thomas
Shepard to some ministers from his death-bed, &lsquo;I never preached
a sermon which, in the composing, did not cost me prayers, with strong
cries and tears.&nbsp; I never preached a sermon from which I had not
first got some good to my own soul.&rsquo;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;His office and his name agree;<br />
A shepherd that and Shepard he.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And many such entries as these occur in Thomas Boston&rsquo;s golden
journal: &lsquo;I preached in Ps. xlii. 5, and mostly on my own account.&rsquo;&nbsp;
Again: &lsquo;Meditating my sermon next day, I found advantage to my
own soul, as also in delivering it on the Sabbath.&rsquo;&nbsp; And
again: &lsquo;What good this preaching has done to others I know not,
yet I think myself will not the worse of it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; The preaching of that Fast-day was with great authority
also.&nbsp; &lsquo;There was such power and authority in that sermon,&rsquo;
reports one who was present, &lsquo;that the like had seldom been seen
or heard.&rsquo;&nbsp; Authority also was one of the well-remembered
marks of our Lord&rsquo;s preaching.&nbsp; And no wonder, considering
who He was.&nbsp; But His ministers, if they are indeed His ministers,
will be clothed by Him with something even of His supreme authority.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Conscience is an authority,&rsquo; says one of the most authoritative
preachers that ever lived.&nbsp; &lsquo;The Bible is an authority; such
is the Church; such is antiquity; such are the words of the wise; such
are hereditary lessons; such are ethical truths; such are historical
memories; such are legal saws and state maxims; such are proverbs; such
are sentiments, presages, and prepossessions.&rsquo;&nbsp; Now, the
well-equipped preacher will from time to time plant his pulpit on all
those kinds of authority, as this kind is now pertinent and then that,
and will, with such a variety and accumulation of authority, preach
to his people.&nbsp; Thomas Boston preached at a certain place with
such pertinence and with such authority that it was complained of him
by one of themselves that he &lsquo;terrified even the godly.&rsquo;&nbsp;
Let all our young preachers who would to old age continue to preach
with interest, with pertinence, and with terrifying authority, among
other things have by heart <i>The Memoirs of Thomas Boston</i>, &lsquo;that
truly great divine.&rsquo;</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; A third thing, and, as some of the people who heard it said
of it, the best thing about that sermon was that&mdash;&lsquo;He did
not only show us our sin, but he did visibly tremble before us under
the sense of his own.&rsquo;&nbsp; Now I know this to be a great difficulty
with some young ministers who have got no help in it at the Divinity
Hall.&nbsp; Are they, they ask, to be themselves in the pulpit?&nbsp;
How far may they be themselves, and how far may they be not themselves?&nbsp;
How far are they to be seen to tremble before their people because of
their own sins, and how far are they to bear themselves as if they had
no sin?&nbsp; Must they keep back the passions that are tearing their
own hearts, and fill the forenoon with Euroclydon and other suchlike
sea-winds?&nbsp; How far are they to be all gown and bands in the pulpit,
and how far sackcloth and ashes?&nbsp; One half of their people are
like Pascal in this, that they like to see and hear a man in his pulpit;
but, then, the other half like only to see and hear a proper preacher.&nbsp;
&lsquo;He did not only show the men of Mansoul their sin, but he did
tremble before them under the sense of his own.&nbsp; Still crying out
as he preached to them, Unhappy man that I am! that I should have done
so wicked a thing!&nbsp; That I, a preacher, should be one of the first
in the transgression!&rsquo;</p>
<p>This you will remember was the Fast-day.&nbsp; And so truly had this
preacher kept the Fast-day that the Communion-day was down upon him
before he was ready for it.&nbsp; He was still deep among his sins when
all his people were fast putting on their beautiful garments.&nbsp;
He was ready with the letter of his action-sermon, but he was not equal
to the delivery of it.&nbsp; His colleague, accordingly, whose sense
of sin was less acute that day, took the public worship, while the Fast-day
preacher still lay sick in his closet at home and wrote thus on the
ground: &lsquo;I am no more worthy to be called Thy son,&rsquo; he wrote.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Behold me here, Lord, a poor, miserable sinner, weary of myself,
and afraid to look up to Thee.&nbsp; Wilt Thou heal my sores?&nbsp;
Wilt Thou take out the stains?&nbsp; Wilt Thou deliver me from the shame?&nbsp;
Wilt Thou rescue me from this chain of sin?&nbsp; Cut me not off in
the midst of my sins.&nbsp; Let me have liberty once again to be among
Thy redeemed ones, eating and drinking at Thy table.&nbsp; But, O my
God, to-day I am an unclean worm, a dead dog, a dead carcass, deservedly
cast out from the society of Thy saints.&nbsp; But oh, suffer me so
much as to look to the place where Thy people meet and where Thine honour
dwelleth.&nbsp; Reject not the sacrifice of a broken heart, but come
and speak to me in my secret place.&nbsp; O God, let me never see such
another day as this is.&nbsp; Let me never be again so full of guilt
as to have to run away from Thy presence and to flee from before Thy
people.&rsquo;&nbsp; He printed more than that, in blood and in tears,
before God that Communion-morning, but that is enough for my purpose.&nbsp;
Now, would you choose a dead dog like that to be your minister?&nbsp;
To baptize and admit your children and to marry them when they grow
up?&nbsp; To mount your pulpits every Sabbath-day, and to come to your
houses every week-day?&nbsp; Not, I feel sure, if you could help it!&nbsp;
Not if you knew it!&nbsp; Not if there was a minister of proper pulpit
manners and a well-ordered mind within a Sabbath-day&rsquo;s journey!&nbsp;
&lsquo;Like priest like people,&rsquo; says Hosea.&nbsp; &lsquo;The
congregation and the minister are one,&rsquo; says Dr. Parker.&nbsp;
&lsquo;There are men we could not sit still and hear; they are not the
proper ministers for us.&nbsp; There are other men we could hear always,
because they are our kith and our kin from before the foundation of
the world.&rsquo;&nbsp; Happy the hearer who has hit on a minister like
the minister of Mansoul, and who has discovered in him his everlasting
kith and kin.&nbsp; And happy the minister who, owning kith and kin
with Boanerges, has two or three or even one member in his congregation
who likes his minister best when he likes himself worst.</p>
<p>But what about the fasting all this time?&nbsp; Was it all preaching,
and was there no fasting?&nbsp; Well, we do not know much about the
fasting of the prophets and the apostles, but the Puritans sometimes
made their people almost forget about fasting, and about eating and
drinking too, they so took possession of their people with their incomparable
preaching.&nbsp; I read, for instance, in Calamy&rsquo;s <i>Life of
John Howe</i> that on the public Fast-days, it was Howe&rsquo;s common
way to begin about nine in the morning and to continue reading, preaching,
and praying till about four in the afternoon.&nbsp; Henry Rogers almost
worships John Howe, but John Howe&rsquo;s Fast-days pass his modern
biographers patience; till, if you would see a nineteenth-century case
made out against a seventeenth-century Fast-day, you have only to turn
to the author of <i>The Eclipse of Faith</i> on the author of <i>Delighting
in God</i>.&nbsp; And, no doubt, when we get back our Fast-days, we
shall leave more of the time to reading pertinent books at home and
to secret fasting and to secret prayer, and shall enjoin our preachers,
while they are pertinent and authoritative in their sermons, not to
take up the whole day with their sermons even at their best.&nbsp; And
then, as to fasting, discredited and discarded as it is in our day,
there are yet some very good reasons for desiring its return and reinstatement
among us.&nbsp; Very good reasons, both for health and for holiness.&nbsp;
But it is only of the latter class of reasons that I would fain for
a few words at present speak.&nbsp; Well, then, let it be frankly said
that there is nothing holy, nothing saintly, nothing at all meritorious
in fasting from our proper food.&nbsp; It is the motive alone that sanctifies
the means.&nbsp; It is the end alone that sanctifies the exercise.&nbsp;
If I fast to chastise myself for my sin; if I fast to reduce the fuel
of my sin; if I fast to keep my flesh low; if I fast to make me more
free for my best books, for my most inward, spiritual, mystical books&mdash;for
my Kempis, and my Behmen, and my Law, and my Leighton, and my Goodwin,
and my Bunyan, and my Rutherford, and my Jeremy Taylor, and my Shepard,
and my Edwards, and suchlike; if I fast for the ends of meditation and
prayer; if I fast out of sympathy with my Bible, and my Saviour, and
my latter end, and my Father&rsquo;s house in heaven&mdash;then, no
doubt, my fasting will be acceptable with God, as it will certainly
be an immediate means of grace to my sinful soul.&nbsp; These altars
will sanctify many such gifts.&nbsp; For, who that knows anything at
all about himself, about his own soul, and about the hindrances and
helps to its salvation from sin; who that ever read a page of Scripture
properly, or spent half an hour in that life which is hidden in God&mdash;who
of such will deny or doubt that fasting is superseded or neglected to
the sure loss of the spiritual life, to the sensible lowering of the
religious tone and temper, and to the increase both of the lusts of
the flesh and of the mind?&nbsp; It may perhaps be that the institution
of fasting as a church ordinance has been permitted to be set aside
in order to make it more than ever a part of each earnest man&rsquo;s
own private life.&nbsp; Perhaps it was in some ways full time that it
should be again said to us, &lsquo;Thou, when thou fastest, appear not
unto men to fast.&rsquo;&nbsp; As also, &lsquo;Is not this the fast
that I have chosen: to undo the heavy burdens, and to let the oppressed
go free, and that ye break every yoke?&nbsp; Is it not to deal thy bread
to the hungry, and that thou bring the outcast to thy house?&rsquo;&nbsp;
Let us believe that the form of the Fast-day has been removed out of
the way that the spirit may return and fashion a new form for itself.&nbsp;
And in the belief that that is so, let us, while parting with our fathers&rsquo;
Fast-days with real regret&mdash;as with their pertinent and pungent
preaching&mdash;let us meantime lay in a stock of their pertinent and
pungent books, and set apart particular and peculiar seasons for their
sin-subduing and grace-strengthening study.</p>
<p>The short is this.&nbsp; The one real substance and true essence
of all fasting is self-denial.&nbsp; And we can never get past either
the supreme and absolute duty of that, or the daily and hourly call
to that, as long as we continue to read the New Testament, to live in
this life, and to listen to the voice of conscience, and to the voice
of God speaking to us in the voice of conscience.&nbsp; Without strict
and constant self-denial, no man, whatever his experiences or his pretensions,
is a disciple of Jesus Christ, and secret fasting is one of the first,
the easiest, and the most elementary exercises of New Testament self-denial.&nbsp;
And, besides, the lusts of our flesh and the lusts of our minds are
so linked and locked and riveted together that if one link is loosened,
or broken, or even struck at, the whole thrall is not yet thrown off
indeed, but it is all shaken; it has all received a staggering blow.&nbsp;
So much is this the case that one single act of self-denial in the region
of the body will be felt for freedom throughout the whole prison-house
of the soul.&nbsp; And a victory really won over a sensual sin is already
a challenge sounded to our most spiritual sin.&nbsp; And it is this
discovery that has given to fasting the place it has held in all the
original, resolute, and aggressive ages of the Church.&nbsp; With little
or nothing in their Lord&rsquo;s literal teaching to make His people
fast, they have been so bent on their own spiritual deliverance, and
they have heard and read so much about the deliverances both of body
and of soul that have been attained by fasting and its accompaniments,
that they have taken to it in their despair, and with results that have
filled them in some instances with rapture, and in all instances with
a good conscience and with a good hope.&nbsp; You would wonder, even
in these degenerate days,&mdash;you would be amazed could you be told
how many of your own best friends in their stealthy, smiling, head-anointing,
hypocritical way deny themselves this and that sweetness, this and that
fatness, this and that softness, and are thus attaining to a strength,
a courage, and a self-conquest that you are getting the benefit of in
many ways without your ever guessing the price at which it has all been
purchased.&nbsp; Now, would you yourself fain be found among those who
are in this way being made strong and victorious inwardly and spiritually?&nbsp;
Would you?&nbsp; Then wash your face and anoint your head; and, then,
not denying it before others, deny it in secret to yourself&mdash;this
and that sweet morsel, this and that sweet meat, this and that glass
of such divine wine.&nbsp; Unostentatiously, ungrudgingly, generous-heartedly,
and not ascetically or morosely, day after day deny yourself even in
little unthought-of things, and one of the very noblest laws of your
noblest life shall immediately claim you as its own.&nbsp; That stealthy
and shamefaced act of self-denial for Christ&rsquo;s sake and for His
cross&rsquo;s sake will lay the foundation of a habit of self-denial;
ere ever you are aware of what you are doing the habit will consolidate
into a character; and what you begin little by little in the body will
be made perfect in the soul; till what you did, almost against His command
and altogether without His example, yet because you did it for His sake
and in His service, will have placed you far up among those who have
forsaken all, and themselves also, to follow Jesus Christ, Son of Man
and Son of God.&nbsp; Only, let this always be admitted, and never for
a moment forgotten, that all this is said by permission and not of commandment.&nbsp;
Our Lord never fasted as we fast.&nbsp; He had no need.&nbsp; And He
never commanded His disciples to fast.&nbsp; He left it to themselves
to find out each man his own case and his own cure.&nbsp; Let no man,
therefore, take fasting in any of its degrees, or times, or occasions,
on his conscience who does not first find it in his heart.&nbsp; At
the same time this may be said with perfect safety, that he who finds
it in his heart and then lays it on his conscience to deny himself anything,
great or small, for Christ&rsquo;s sake, and for the sake of his own
salvation,&mdash;he will never repent it.&nbsp; No, he will never repent
it.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXV&mdash;A FEAST-DAY IN MANSOUL</h2>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;He brought me into his banqueting house.&rsquo;&mdash;<i>The
Song</i>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Emmanuel&rsquo;s feast-day in the Holy War excels in beauty and in
eloquence everything I know in any other author on the Lord&rsquo;s
Supper.&nbsp; The Song of Solomon stands alone when we sing that song
mystically&mdash;that is to say, when we pour into it all the love of
God to His Church in Israel and all Israel&rsquo;s love to God, and
then all our Lord&rsquo;s love to us and all our love back again to
Him in return.&nbsp; But outside of Holy Scripture I know nothing to
compare for beauty, and for sweetness, and for quaintness, and for tenderness,
and for rapture, with John Bunyan&rsquo;s account of the feast that
Prince Emmanuel made for the town of Mansoul.&nbsp; With his very best
pen John Bunyan tells us how upon a time Emmanuel made a feast in Mansoul,
and how the townsfolk came to the castle to partake of His banquet,
and how He feasted them on all manner of outlandish food&mdash;food
that grew not in the fields of Mansoul; it was food that came down from
heaven and from His Father&rsquo;s house.&nbsp; They drank also of the
water that was made wine, and, altogether, they were very merry and
at home with their Prince.&nbsp; There was music also all the time at
the table, and man did eat angels&rsquo; food, and had honey given him
out of the rock.&nbsp; And then the table was entertained with some
curious and delightful riddles that were made upon the King Himself,
upon Emmanuel His Son, and upon His wars and doings with Mansoul; till,
altogether, the state of transportation the people were in with their
entertainment cannot be told by the very best of pens.&nbsp; Nor did
He, when they returned to their places, send them empty away; for either
they must have a ring, or a gold chain, or a bracelet, or a white stone
or something; so dear was Mansoul to Him now, so lovely was Mansoul
in His eyes.&nbsp; And, going and coming to the feast, O how graciously,
how lovingly, how courteously, and how tenderly did this blessed Prince
now carry it to the town of Mansoul!&nbsp; In all the streets, gardens,
orchards, and other places where He came, to be sure the poor should
have His blessing and benediction; yea, He would kiss them; and if they
were ill, He would lay His hands on them and make them well.&nbsp; And
was it not now something amazing to behold that in that very place where
Diabolus had had his abode, the Prince of princes should now sit eating
and drinking with all His mighty captains, and men of war, and trumpeters,
and with the singing men and the singing women of His Father&rsquo;s
court!&nbsp; Now did Mansoul&rsquo;s cup run over; now did her conduits
run sweet wine; now did she eat the finest of the wheat, and now drink
milk and honey out of the rock!&nbsp; Now she said, How great is His
goodness, for ever since I found favour in His eyes, how honourable
have I ever been!</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; Now, the beginning of it all was, and the best of it all
was, that Emmanuel Himself made the feast.&nbsp; Mansoul did not feast
her Deliverer; it was her Deliverer who feasted her.&nbsp; Mansoul,
in good sooth, had nothing that she had not first and last received,
and it was far more true and seemly and fit in every way that her Prince
Himself should in His own way and at His own expense seal and celebrate
the deliverance, the freedom, the life, the peace, and the joy of Mansoul.&nbsp;
And, besides, what had Mansoul to set before her Prince; or, for the
matter of that, before herself?&nbsp; Mansoul had nothing of herself.&nbsp;
Mansoul was not sufficient of herself for a single day.&nbsp; And how,
then, should she propose to feast a Prince?&nbsp; No, no! the thing
was impossible.&nbsp; It was Emmanuel&rsquo;s feast from first to last.&nbsp;
Just as it was at the Lord&rsquo;s table in this house this morning.&nbsp;
You did not spread the table this morning for your Lord.&nbsp; You did
not make ready for your Saviour and then invite Him in.&nbsp; He invited
you.&nbsp; He said, This is My Body broken for you, and This is My Blood
shed for you; drink ye all of it.&nbsp; And had any one challenged you
at the fence door and asked you how one who could not pay his own debts
or provide himself a proper meal even for a single day, could dare to
sit down with such a company at such a feast as that, you would have
told him that he had not seen half your hunger and your nakedness; but
that it was just your very hunger and nakedness and homelessness that
had brought you here; or, rather, it was all that that had moved the
Master of the feast to send for you and to compel you to come here.&nbsp;
There was nothing in your mind and in your mouth more all this day than
just that this is the Lord&rsquo;s Supper, and that He had sent for
you and had invited you, and had constrained and compelled you to come
and partake of it.&nbsp; It was the Lord&rsquo;s Table to-day, and it
will be still and still more His table on that great Communion-Day when
all our earthly communions shall be accomplished and consummated in
heaven.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; All that Mansoul did in connection with that great feast
was to prepare the place where Diabolus at one time had held his orgies
and carried on his excesses.&nbsp; Her Prince, Emmanuel, did all the
rest; but He left it to Mansoul to make the banqueting-room ready.&nbsp;
When our Lord would keep His last passover with His disciples, He said
to Peter and John, Go into the city, and there shall meet you a man
bearing a pitcher of water, and he will show you a large upper room
furnished and prepared.&nbsp; There is some reason to believe that that
happy man had been expecting that message and had done his best to be
ready for it.&nbsp; And now he was putting the last touch to his preparations
by filling the water-pots of his house with fresh water; little thinking,
happy man, that as long as the world lasts that water will be holy water
in all men&rsquo;s eyes, and shall teach humility to all men&rsquo;s
hearts.&nbsp; And, my brethren, you know that all you did all last week
against to-day was just to prepare the room.&nbsp; For the room all
last week and all this day was your own heart, and not and never this
house of stone and lime made with men&rsquo;s hands.&nbsp; You swept
the inner and upper room of your own heart.&nbsp; You swept it and garnished
its walls and its floors as much as in you lay.&nbsp; He, whose the
supper really was, told you that He would bring with Him what was to
be eaten and drunken to-day, while you were to prepare the place.&nbsp;
And, next to the very actual feast itself, and, sometimes, not next
to it but equal to it, and even before it and better than it, were those
busy household hours you spent, like the man with the pitcher, making
the room ready.&nbsp; In plain English, you had a communion before the
Communion as you prepared your hearts for the Communion.&nbsp; I shall
not intrude into your secret places and secret seasons with Christ before
His open reception of you to-day.&nbsp; But it is sure and certain that,
just as you in secret entertained Him in your mother&rsquo;s house and
in the chambers of her that bare you, just in that measure did He say
to you openly before all the watchmen that go about the city and before
all the daughters of Jerusalem, Eat, O friends; drink, yea, drink abundantly,
O beloved.&nbsp; Yes; do you not think that the man with the pitcher
had his reward?&nbsp; He had his own thoughts as he furnished, till
it was quite ready, his best upper room and carried in those pitchers
of water, and handed down to his children in after days the perquisite-skin
of the paschal lamb that had been supped on by our Lord and His disciples
in his honoured house that night.&nbsp; Yes; was it not amazing to behold
that in that very place where sometimes Diabolus had his abode, and
had entertained his Diabolonians, the Prince of princes should sit eating
and drinking with His friends?&nbsp; Was it not truly amazing?</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; Now, upon the feasting-day He feasted them with all manner
of outlandish food&mdash;food that grew not in all the fields of Mansoul;
it was food that came down with His Father&rsquo;s court.&nbsp; The
fields of Mansoul yielded their own proper fruits, and fruits that were
not to be despised.&nbsp; But they were not the proper fruits for that
day, neither could they be placed upon that table.&nbsp; They are good
enough fruits for their purpose, and as far as they go, and for so long
as they last and are in their season.&nbsp; But our souls are such that
they outlive their own best fruits; their hunger and their thirst outlast
all that can be harvested in from their own fields.&nbsp; And thus it
is that He who made Mansoul at first, and who has since redeemed her,
has out of His own great goodness provided food convenient for her.&nbsp;
He knows with what an outlandish life He has quickened Mansoul, and
it is only the part of a faithful Creator to provide for His creature
her proper nourishment.&nbsp; What is it? asked the children of Israel
at one another when they saw a small round thing, as small as hoarfrost,
upon the ground.&nbsp; For they wist not what it was.&nbsp; And Moses
said, Gather of it every man according to his eating, an omer for every
man, according to the number of your persons.&nbsp; And the house of
Israel called the name thereof Manna, and the taste of it was like wafers
made with honey.&nbsp; He gave them of the corn of heaven to eat, and
man did eat in the wilderness angels&rsquo; food.&nbsp; Your fathers
did eat manna in the wilderness, and are dead; but this is the bread
of which if any man eat he shall not die.&nbsp; And the bread that I
will give is My Flesh, which I will give for the life of the world.&nbsp;
And so outlandish, so supernatural, and so full of heavenly wonder and
heavenly mystery was that bread, that the Jews strove among themselves
over it, and could not understand it.&nbsp; But, by His goodness and
His truth to us this day, we have again, to our spiritual nourishment
and growth in grace, eaten the Flesh and drunk the Blood of the Son
of God; a meat that, as He who Himself is that meat has said of it,
is meat indeed and drink indeed&mdash;as, indeed, we have the witness
in ourselves this day that it is.&nbsp; They drank also of the water
that was made wine, and were very merry with Him all that day at His
table.&nbsp; And all their mirth was the high mirth of heaven; it was
a mirth and a gladness without sin, without satiety, and without remorse.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; There was music also all the while at the table, and the
musicians were not those of the country of Mansoul, but they were the
masters of song come down from the court of the King.&nbsp; &lsquo;I
love the Lord,&rsquo; they sang in the supper room over the paschal
lamb&mdash;&lsquo;I love the Lord because He hath heard my voice and
my supplication.&nbsp; Because He hath inclined His ear unto me, therefore
will I call upon Him as long as I live.&nbsp; What shall I render to
the Lord,&rsquo; they challenged one another, &lsquo;for all His benefits
towards me?&nbsp; I will take the cup of salvation, and will call upon
the name of the Lord.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Sometimes imagine,&rsquo;
says a great devotional writer with a great imagination&mdash;&lsquo;Sometimes
imagine that you had been one of those that joined with our blessed
Saviour as He sang an hymn.&nbsp; Strive to imagine to yourself with
what majesty He looked.&nbsp; Fancy that you had stood by Him surrounded
with His glory.&nbsp; Think how your heart would have been inflamed,
and what ecstasies of joy you would have then felt when singing with
the Son of God!&nbsp; Think again and again with what joy and devotion
you would have then sung had this really been your happy state; and
what a punishment you would have thought it to have then been silent.&nbsp;
And let that teach you how to be affected with psalms and hymns of thanksgiving.&rsquo;&nbsp;
Yes; and it is no imagination; it was our own experience only this morning
and afternoon to join in a music that was never made in this world,
but which was as outlandish as was the meat which we ate while the music
was being made.</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Bless, O my soul, the Lord thy God,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And not forgetful be<br />
Of all His gracious benefits<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; He hath bestow&rsquo;d on thee.</p>
<p>Who with abundance of good things<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Doth satisfy thy mouth;<br />
So that, ev&rsquo;n as the eagle&rsquo;s age,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Renewed is thy youth.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The 103rd Psalm was never made in this world.&nbsp; Musicians far
other than those native to Mansoul made for us our Lord&rsquo;s-Table
Psalm.</p>
<p>5.&nbsp; And then, the riddles that were made upon the King Himself,
and upon Emmanuel His Son, and upon Emmanuel&rsquo;s wars and all His
other doings with Mansoul.&nbsp; And when Emmanuel would expound some
of those riddles Himself, oh! how they were lightened!&nbsp; They saw
what they never saw!&nbsp; They could not have thought that such rarities
could have been couched in so few and such ordinary words.&nbsp; Yea,
they did gather that the things themselves were a kind of portraiture,
and that, too, of Emmanuel Himself.&nbsp; This, they would say, this
is the Lamb! this is the Sacrifice! this is the Rock! this is the Door!
and this is the Way! with a great many other things.&nbsp; At Gaius&rsquo;s
supper-table they sat up over their riddles and nuts and sweetmeats
till the sun was in the sky.&nbsp; And it would be midnight and morning
if I were to show you the answers to the half of the riddles.&nbsp;
Take one, for an example, and let it be one of the best for the communion-day.&nbsp;
&lsquo;In one rare quality of the orator,&rsquo; says Hugh Miller, writing
about his adored minister, Alexander Stewart of Cromarty, &lsquo;Mr.
Stewart stood alone.&nbsp; Pope refers in his satires to a strange power
of creating love and admiration by just &ldquo;touching the brink of
all we hate.&rdquo;&nbsp; Now, into this perilous, but singularly elective
department, Mr. Stewart could enter with safety and at will.&nbsp; We
heard him, scarce a twelvemonth since, deliver a discourse of singular
power on the sin-offering as minutely described by the divine penman
in Leviticus.&nbsp; He described the slaughtered animal&mdash;foul with
dust and blood, its throat gashed across, its entrails laid open and
steaming in its impurity to the sun&mdash;a vile and horrid thing, which
no one could look on without disgust, nor touch without defilement.&nbsp;
The picture appeared too vivid; its introduction too little in accordance
with a just taste.&nbsp; But this pulpit-master knew what he was all
the time doing.&nbsp; &ldquo;And that,&rdquo; he said, as he pointed
to the terrible picture, &ldquo;that is SIN!&rdquo;&nbsp; By one stroke
the intended effect was produced, and the rising disgust and horror
transferred from the revolting, material image to the great moral evil.&rsquo;&nbsp;
And, in like manner, This is the LAMB! we all said over the mystical
riddle of the bread and the wine this morning.&nbsp; This is the SACRIFICE!&nbsp;
This is the DOOR!&nbsp; This is EMMANUEL, GOD WITH US, and made sin
for us!</p>
<p>6.&nbsp; In one of his finest chapters, Thomas &Agrave; Kempis tells
us in what way we are to communicate mystically: that is to say, how
we are to keep on communicating at all times, and in all places, without
the intervention of the consecrated sacramental elements.&nbsp; And
John Bunyan, the sweetest and most spiritual of mystics, has all that,
too, in this same supreme passage.&nbsp; Every day was a feast-day now,
he tells us.&nbsp; So much so that when the elders and the townsmen
did not come to Emmanuel, He would send in much plenty of provisions
to them.&nbsp; Yea, such delicates would He send them, and therewith
would so cover their tables, that whosoever saw it confessed that the
like could not be seen in any other kingdom.&nbsp; That is to say, my
fellow-communicants, there is nothing that we experienced and enjoyed
in this house this day that we may not experience and enjoy again to-morrow
and every day in our own house at home.&nbsp; All the mystics worth
the noble name will tell you that all true communicating is always performed
and experienced in the prepared heart, and never in any upper room,
or church, or chapel, or new heaven, or new earth.&nbsp; The prepared
heart of every worthy communicant is the true upper room; it is the
true banqueting chamber; it is the true and the only house of wine.&nbsp;
Our Father&rsquo;s House itself, with its supper-table covered with
the new wine of the Kingdom&mdash;the best of it all will still be within
you.&nbsp; Prepare yourselves within yourselves, then, O departing and
dispersing communicants.&nbsp; Prepare, and keep yourselves always prepared.&nbsp;
And as often as you so prepare yourselves your Prince will come to you
every day, and will cat and drink with you, till He makes every day
on earth a day of heaven already to you.&nbsp; See if He will not; for,
again and again, He who keeps all His promises says that He will.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXVI&mdash;EMMANUEL&rsquo;S LIVERY</h2>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;And to her was granted that she should be arrayed
in fine linen, clean and white; for the fine linen is the righteousness
of saints.&rsquo;&mdash;<i>John</i>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Plantagenet kings of ancient England had white and scarlet for
their livery; white and green was the livery of the Tudors; the Stuarts
wore red and yellow; while blue and scarlet colours adorn to-day the
House of Hanover.&nbsp; And the Prince of the kings of the earth, He
has his royal colours also, and His servants have their badge of honour
and their blazon also.&nbsp; Then He commanded that those who waited
upon Him should go and bring forth out of His treasury those white and
glittering robes, that I, He said, have provided and laid up in store
for my Mansoul.&nbsp; So the white garments were fetched out of the
treasury and laid forth to the eyes of the people.&nbsp; Moreover, it
was granted to them that they should take them and put them on, according,
said He, to your size and your stature.&nbsp; So the people were all
put into white&mdash;into fine linen, clean and white.&nbsp; Then said
the Prince, This, O Mansoul, is My livery, and this is the badge by
which Mine are known from the servants of others.&nbsp; Yea, this livery
is that which I grant to all them that are Mine, and without which no
man is permitted to see My face.&nbsp; Wear this livery, therefore,
for My sake, and, also, if you would be known by the world to be Mine.&nbsp;
But now can you think how Mansoul shone!&nbsp; For Mansoul was fair
as the sun, clear as the moon, and terrible as an army with banners.</p>
<p>White, then, and whiter than snow, is the very livery of heaven.&nbsp;
A hundred shining Scriptures could be quoted to establish that.&nbsp;
In the first year of Belshazzar, King of Babylon, Daniel had a dream,
and visions of his head came to Daniel upon his bed.&nbsp; And, behold,
the Ancient of Days did sit, whose garment was white as snow, and the
hair of his head like the pure wool.&nbsp; My beloved, sings the spouse
in the Song, is white and ruddy, the chiefest among ten thousand, and
altogether lovely.&nbsp; Then, again, David in his penitence sings,
Purge me with hyssop, and I shall be clean; wash me, and I shall be
whiter than snow.&nbsp; And what is it that sets Isaiah at the head
of all the prophets?&nbsp; What but this, that he is the mouth-piece
of such decrees in heaven as this: Though your sins be as scarlet, they
shall be white as snow; though they be red like crimson, they shall
be as wool.&nbsp; The angel, also, who rolled away the stone from the
door of the sepulchre was clothed in a long white garment.&nbsp; Another
evangelist says that his countenance was like lightning and his raiment
white as snow, and for fear of him the keepers did quake, and became
as dead men.&nbsp; But before that we read that Jesus was transfigured
before Peter and James and John on the Mount, and that His face did
shine as the sun, and His raiment was white as the light.&nbsp; And,
then, the whole Book of Revelation is written with a pen dipped in heavenly
light.&nbsp; The whole book is glistening with the whitest light till
we cannot read it for the brightness thereof.&nbsp; And the multitude
that no man can number all display themselves before our eyes, clothed
with white robes and with palms in their hands, so much so that we sink
down under the greatness of the glory, till One with His head and His
hairs white like wool, as white as snow, lays His hand upon us, and
says to us, Fear not, for, behold, I have caused thine iniquity to pass
from thee, and I will clothe thee with change of raiment.</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;I also saw Mansoul clad all in white,<br />
And heard her Prince call her His heart&rsquo;s delight,<br />
I saw Him put upon her chains of gold,<br />
And rings and bracelets goodly to behold.<br />
What shall I say?&nbsp; I heard the people&rsquo;s cries,<br />
And saw the Prince wipe tears from Mansoul&rsquo;s eyes,<br />
I heard the groans and saw the joy of many;<br />
Tell you of all, I neither will nor can I.<br />
But by what here I say you well may see<br />
That Mansoul&rsquo;s matchless wars no fable be.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&lsquo;And to her it was granted that she should be arrayed in fine
linen, clean and white; for the fine linen is the righteousness of saints.&rsquo;&nbsp;
We need no exegesis of that beautiful Scripture beyond that exegesis
which our own hearts supply.&nbsp; And if we did need that shining text
to be explained to us, to whom could we better go for its explanation
than just to John Bunyan?&nbsp; Well, then, in our author&rsquo;s <i>No
Way to Heaven but by Jesus Christ</i>, he says: &lsquo;This fine linen,
in my judgment, is the works of godly men; their works that spring from
faith.&nbsp; But how came they clean?&nbsp; How came they white?&nbsp;
Not simply because they were the works of faith.&nbsp; But, mark, they
washed their robes and made them white in the blood of the Lamb.&nbsp;
And therefore they are before the throne of God.&nbsp; Yea, therefore
it is that their good works stand in such a place.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Nor
must we think it strange,&rsquo; says John Howe, in his <i>Blessedness
of the Righteous</i>, &lsquo;that all the requisites to our salvation
are not found together in one text of Scripture.&nbsp; I conceive that
imputed righteousness is not here meant, but that righteousness which
is truly subjected in a child of God and descriptive of him.&nbsp; The
righteousness of Him whom we adore as made sin for us that we might
be made the righteousness of God in Him, that righteousness has a much
higher sphere peculiar and appropriate to itself.&nbsp; Though this
of which we now speak is necessary also to be both had and understood.&rsquo;&nbsp;
Emmanuel&rsquo;s livery, then, is the righteousness of the saints.&nbsp;
Emmanuel puts that righteousness upon all His saints; while, at the
same time, they put it on themselves; they work it out for themselves,
and for themselves they keep it clean.&nbsp; They work it out, put it
on, and keep it clean, and yet, all the time, it is not they that do
it, but it is Emmanuel that doeth it all in them.&nbsp; The truth is,
you must all become mystics before you will admit all the strange truth
that is told about Emmanuel&rsquo;s livery.&nbsp; For both heaven and
earth unite in this wonderful livery.&nbsp; Nature and grace unite in
it.&nbsp; It is woven by the gospel on the loom of the law&mdash;till,
to tell you all that is true about it, I neither can nor will I.&nbsp;
Albert Bengel tells us that the court of heaven has its own jealous
and scrupulous etiquette; and our court journalist and historian, John
Bunyan, has supplied his favoured readers with the very card of etiquette
that was issued along with Mansoul&rsquo;s coat of livery, and it is
more than time that we had attended to that card.</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; The first item then in that etiquette-card ran in these
set terms: &lsquo;First, wear these white robes daily, day by day, lest
you should at some time appear to others as if you were none of Mine.&mdash;Signed,
EMMANUEL.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Now, we put on anew every morning the garments that we are to wear
every new day.&nbsp; We have certain pieces of clothing that we wear
in the morning; we have certain pieces that we wear when we are at our
work; and, again, we have certain other pieces that we put on when we
go abroad in the afternoon; and, yet again, certain other pieces that
we array ourselves in when we go out into society in the evening.&nbsp;
After a night in which Mercy could not sleep for blessing and praising
God, they all rose in the morning with the sun; but the Interpreter
would have them tarry a while, for, said he, you must orderly go from
hence.&nbsp; Then said he to the damsel, Take them, and have them into
the garden to the bath.&nbsp; Then Innocent the damsel took them, and
had them into the garden, and brought them to the bath.&nbsp; Then they
went in and washed, yea, they and the boys and all, and they came out
of that bath, not only clean and sweet, but also much enlivened and
much strengthened in their joints.&nbsp; So when they came in they looked
fairer a deal than when they went out.&nbsp; Then said the Interpreter
to the damsel that waited upon those women, Go into the vestry, and
fetch out garments for these people.&nbsp; So she went and fetched out
white raiment and laid it down before him.&nbsp; And then he commanded
them to put it on.&nbsp; It was fine linen, white and clean.&nbsp; Now,
therefore, they began to esteem each other better than themselves.&nbsp;
For, You are fairer than I am, said one; and, You are more comely than
I am, said another.&nbsp; The children also stood amazed to see into
what fashion they had been brought.&nbsp; William Law&mdash;I thank
God, I think, every day I live for that good day to me on which He introduced
me to His gifted and saintly servant&mdash;well, William Law used every
morning after his bath in the morning to put on his livery, piece by
piece, in order, and with special prayer.&nbsp; The first piece that
he put on, and he put it on every new morning next his heart to wear
it all the day next his heart, was gratitude to God.&nbsp; And it was
a real, feeling, active, and operative gratitude that he so put on.&nbsp;
On each new morning as it came, that good man was full of new gratitude
to God.&nbsp; For the sun new from his Almighty Maker&rsquo;s hands
he had gratitude.&nbsp; For his house over his head he had gratitude.&nbsp;
For his Bible and his spiritual books he had gratitude.&nbsp; For his
opportunities of reading and study, as also for ten o&rsquo;clock in
the morning when the widows and orphans of King&rsquo;s Cliffe came
to his window, and so on.&nbsp; A grateful heart feeds itself to a still
greater gratitude on everything that comes to it.&nbsp; So it was with
William Law, till he wakened the maids in the rooms below with his psalms
and his hymns as he went into his vestry and put on his singing robes
so early every morning.&nbsp; And then, after his morning hours of study
and devotion, Law had a piece of livery that he always put on and never
came downstairs to breakfast without it.&nbsp; Other men might put on
other pieces; he always clothed himself next to gratitude with humility.&nbsp;
Men differ, good men differ, and Emmanuel&rsquo;s livery-men differ
in what they put on, at what time, and in what order.&nbsp; But that
was William Law&rsquo;s way.&nbsp; You will learn more of his way, and
you will be helped to find out a like way for yourselves, if you will
become students of his incomparable books.&nbsp; You will find how he
put on charity, 1 Cor. thirteenth chapter; and then how, over all, he
put on the will of God; till, thus equipped and thus accoutred, he was
able to say, as it has seldom been said since it was first said, &lsquo;I
put on righteousness, and it clothed me; my judgment was to me as a
robe and as a diadem.&nbsp; The Almighty was then with me, and my children
were about me.&nbsp; When I washed my steps with butter, and when the
rock poured me out rivers of oil!&rsquo;&nbsp; So much for that livery-man
of Emmanuel, the author of the <i>Christian Perfection</i> and the <i>Spirit
of Love</i>.&nbsp; As for the women&rsquo;s vestry in the Interpreter&rsquo;s
House, Matthew Henry saw the thirty-first chapter of the Proverbs hung
up on that vestry wall, and Christiana making her morning toilet before
it with Mercy beside her.&nbsp; Who would find a virtuous woman, let
him look before that looking-glass for her, and he will be sure to find
her and her daughters and her daughters-in-law putting on their white
raiment there.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; &lsquo;Secondly, keep your garments always white; for if
they be soiled, it is a dishonour to Me.&nbsp; I have a few names even
in Sardis which have not defiled their garments, and they shall walk
with Me in white, for they are worthy.&rsquo;&nbsp; Even in Sardis,
with every street and every house full of soil and dishonour to the
name of Christ, even in Sardis Emmanuel had some of whom He could boast
Himself.&nbsp; Would you not immensely like at the last day to be one
of those some in Sardis?&nbsp; Shall it not be splendid when Sardis
comes up for judgment to be among those few names that Emmanuel shall
then read out of His book, and when, at their few names, two or three
men shall step out into the light in His livery?&nbsp; Some of you are
in Sardis at this moment.&nbsp; Some of you are in a city, or in a house
in a city, where it is impossible to keep your garments clean.&nbsp;
And yet, no; nothing is impossible to Emmanuel and His true livery-men.&nbsp;
Even in that house where you are, Emmanuel will say over you, I have
one there who is thankful to My Father and to Me; thankful to singing
every morning where there is little, as men see, to sing for.&nbsp;
There is one in that house humble, where humility itself would almost
become high-minded.&nbsp; And meek, where Moses himself would have lost
his temper.&nbsp; And submissive, where rebelliousness would not have
been without excuse.&nbsp; Mark these few men for Mine, says Emmanuel.&nbsp;
Mark them with the inkhorn for Mine.&nbsp; For they shall surely be
Mine in that day, and they shall walk with Me in white, for they are
worthy.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; &lsquo;Wherefore gird your garments well up from the ground.&rsquo;&nbsp;
A well-dressed man, a well-dressed woman, is a beautiful sight.&nbsp;
Not over-dressed; not dressed so as to call everybody&rsquo;s attention
to their dress; but dressed decorously, becomingly, tastefully.&nbsp;
Each several piece well fitted on, and all of a piece, till it all looks
as if it had grown by nature itself upon the well-dressed wearer.&nbsp;
Be like him&mdash;be like her&mdash;so runs the third head of the etiquette-card.&nbsp;
Be not slovenly and disorderly and unseemly in your livery.&nbsp; Let
not your livery be always falling off, and catching on every bush and
briar, and dropping into every pool and ditch.&nbsp; Hold yourselves
in hand, the instruction goes on.&nbsp; Brace yourselves up.&nbsp; Have
your temper, your tongue, your eyes, your ears, and all your members
in control.&nbsp; And then you will escape many a rent and many a rag;
many a seam and many a patch; many a soil and many a stain.&nbsp; And
then also you will be found walking abroad in comeliness and at liberty,
while others, less careful, are at home mending and washing and ironing
because they went without a girdle when you girt up your garments well
off the ground.&nbsp; Wherefore always gird well up the loins of your
mind.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; &lsquo;And, fourthly, lose not your robes, lest you walk
naked and men see your shame&rsquo;; that is to say, the supreme shame
of your soul.&nbsp; For there is no other shame.&nbsp; There is nothing
else in body or soul to be ashamed about.&nbsp; There is a nakedness,
indeed, that our children are taught to cover; but the Bible is a book
for men.&nbsp; And the only nakedness that the Bible knows about or
cares about is the nakedness of the soul.&nbsp; It was their sudden
soul-nakedness that chased Adam and Eve in among the trees of the garden.&nbsp;
And it is God&rsquo;s pity for soul-naked sinners that has made Him
send His Son to cry to us: &lsquo;I counsel thee,&rsquo; He cries, &lsquo;to
buy of Me gold tried in the fire, that thou mayest be rich; white raiment,
that thou mayest be clothed, and that the shame of thy nakedness do
not appear.&nbsp; Behold!&rsquo; He cries in absolute terror, &lsquo;Behold!&nbsp;
I come as a thief!&nbsp; Blessed is he that walketh and keepeth his
garments, lest he walk naked, and they see his shame.&rsquo;&nbsp; Were
your soul to be stripped naked to all its shame to-morrow; were all
your past to be laid out absolutely naked and bare, with all the utter
nakedness of your inward life this day; were all your secret thoughts,
and all your stealthy schemes, and all your mad imaginations, and all
your detestable motives, and all your hatreds like hell, and all your
follies like Bedlam to be laid naked&mdash;I suppose the horror of it
would make you cry to the rocks and the mountains to cover you this
Sabbath night, or the weeds of the nearest sea to wrap you down into
its depths.&nbsp; It would be hell before the time to you if your soul
were suddenly to be stripped absolutely bare of its ragged body, and
naked of all the thin integuments of time, and were for a single day
to stand naked to its everlasting shame.&nbsp; And it is just because
Jesus Christ sees all that as sure as the judgment-day coming to you,
that He stands here to-night and calls to you: I counsel thee!&nbsp;
I counsel thee!&nbsp; Before it be too late, I again counsel thee!</p>
<p>5.&nbsp; But the Prince Emmanuel is persuaded better things of all
His livery-men, though He thus speaks to them to put them on their guard.&nbsp;
Yes, sternly and severely and threateningly as He sometimes speaks,
yet, in spite of Himself, His real grace always breaks through at the
last.&nbsp; And, accordingly, his fifth command runs thus: But, it runs,
if you should sully them, if you should defile them, the which I am
greatly unwilling that you should, then speed you to that which is written
in My law, that yet you may stand, and not fall before Me and before
My throne.&nbsp; Always know this, that I have provided for thee an
open fountain to wash thy garments in.&nbsp; Look, therefore, that you
wash often in that fountain, and go not for an hour in defiled garments.&nbsp;
Let not, therefore, My garments, your garments, the garments that I
gave thee be ever spotted by the flesh.&nbsp; Keep thy garments always
white, and let thy head lack no ointment.&mdash;Signed in heaven, EMMANUEL.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXVII&mdash;MANSOUL&rsquo;S MAGNA CHARTA</h2>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;A better covenant.&rsquo;&mdash;<i>Paul</i>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Magna Charta is a name very dear to the hearts of the English people.&nbsp;
For, ever since that memorable day on which that noble instrument was
extorted from King John at the point of the sword, England has been
the pioneer to all the other nations of the earth in personal freedom,
in public righteousness, in domestic stability, and in foreign influence
and enterprise.&nbsp; Runnymede is a red-letter spot, and 1215 is a
red-letter year, not only in the history of England, but in the history
of the whole modern world.&nbsp; The keystone of all sound constitutional
government was laid at that place on that date, and by that great bridge
not England only, but after England the whole civilised world has passed
over from ages of bondage and oppression and injustice into a new world
of personal liberty and security, public equity and good faith, loyalty
and peace.&nbsp; All that has since been obtained, whether on the battle-field
or on the floor of Parliament, has been little more than a confirmation
of Magna Charta or an authoritative comment upon Magna Charta.&nbsp;
And if every subsequent law were to be blotted out, yet in Magna Charta
the foundations would still remain of a great state and a free people.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Here commences,&rsquo; says Macaulay, &lsquo;the history of the
English nation.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Now, after the Prince of Peace had subjugated the rebellious city
of Mansoul, He promulgated a proclamation and appointed a day wherein
He would renew their Charter.&nbsp; Yea, a day wherein he would renew
and enlarge their Charter, mending several faults in it, so that the
yoke of Mansoul might be made yet more easy to bear.&nbsp; And this
He did without any desire of theirs, even of His own frankness and nobleness
of mind.&nbsp; So when He had sent for and seen their old Charter, He
laid it by and said, Now that which decayeth and waxeth old is ready
to vanish away.&nbsp; An epitome, therefore, of that new, and better,
and more firm and steady Charter take as follows: I do grant of Mine
own clemency, free, full, and everlasting forgiveness of all their wrongs,
injuries, and offences done against My Father, against Me, against their
neighbours and themselves.&nbsp; I do give them also My Testament, with
all that is therein contained, for their everlasting comfort and consolation.&nbsp;
Thirdly, I do also give them a portion of the self-same grace and goodness
that dwells in My Father&rsquo;s heart and Mine.&nbsp; Fourthly, I do
give, grant, and bestow upon them freely, the world and all that is
therein for their true good; yea, all the benefits of life and death,
of things present and things to come.&nbsp; Free leave and full access
also at all seasons to Me in My palace, there to make known all their
wants to Me; and I give them, moreover, a promise that I shall hear
and redress all their grievances.&nbsp; To them and to their right seed
after them, I hereby bestow all these grants, privileges, and royal
immunities.&nbsp; All this is but a lean epitome of what was that day
laid down in letters of gold and engraven on their doors and their castle
gates.&nbsp; And what joy, what comfort, what consolation, think you,
did now possess every heart in Mansoul!&nbsp; The bells rang out, the
minstrels played, the people danced, the captains shouted, the colours
waved in the wind, and the silver trumpets sounded, till every enemy
inside and outside of Mansoul was now glad to hide his head.</p>
<p>Our constitutional authors and commentators are wont to take Magna
Charta clause by clause, and word by word, and letter by letter.&nbsp;
They linger lovingly and proudly over every jot and tittle of that splendid
instrument.&nbsp; And you will indulge me this Communion night of all
nights of the year if I expatiate still more lovingly and proudly on
that great Covenant which our Lord has sealed to us again to-day, and
has written again to-day on the walls of our hearts.&nbsp; Moses made
haste as soon as the old Charter was read over to him, and nothing shall
delay us till we have feasted our eyes, and our ears, and our hearts
to-night on the contents of this our new and better covenant.</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; The first article of our Magna Charta is free, full, and
everlasting forgiveness of all the wrongs, injuries, and offences we
have ever done against God, against our Saviour, against our neighbour,
and against ourselves.&nbsp; The English nobles extorted their Charter
from their tyrannical king with their sword at his throat, and after
he had signed it, he cast himself on the ground and gnawed sticks and
stones in his fury, so mad was he at the men who had so humiliated him.&nbsp;
&lsquo;They have set four-and-twenty kings over my head,&rsquo; he gnashed
out.&nbsp; How different was it with our Charter!&nbsp; For when we
were yet enemies it was already drawn out in our name.&nbsp; And after
we had been subdued it would never have entered our fearful hearts to
ask for such an instrument.&nbsp; And, even now, after we have entered
into its liberty, how slow we are to believe all that is written in
our great Charter, and read to us every day out of it.&nbsp; And who
shall cast a stone at us for not easily believing all that is so written
and read?&nbsp; It is not so easy as you would think to believe in free
forgiveness for all the wrongs, injuries, and offences we have ever
done.&nbsp; When you try to believe it about yourselves, you will find
how hard it is to accept that covenant and always to keep your feet
firm upon it.&nbsp; That the forgiveness is absolutely free is its first
great difficulty.&nbsp; If it had cost us all we could ever do or suffer,
both in this world and in the world to come, then we could have come
to terms with our Prince far more easily; but that our forgiveness should
be absolutely free, it is that that so staggers us.&nbsp; When I was
a little boy I was once wandering through the streets of a large city
seeing the strange sights.&nbsp; I had even less Latin in my head that
day than I had money in my pocket.&nbsp; But I was hungry for knowledge
and eager to see rare and wonderful things.&nbsp; Over the door of a
public institution, containing a museum and other interesting things,
I tried to read a Latin scroll.&nbsp; I could not make out the whole
of the writing; I could only make out one word, and not even that, as
the event soon showed.&nbsp; The word was <i>gratia</i>, or some modification
of <i>gratia</i>, with some still deeper words engraven round about
it.&nbsp; But on the strength of that one word I mounted the steps and
rang the bell, and asked the porter if I could see the museum.&nbsp;
He told me that the cost of admission was such and such.&nbsp; Little
as it was, it was too much for me, and I came down the steps feeling
that the Latin writing above the door had entirely deceived me.&nbsp;
It has not been the last time that my bad Latin has brought me to shame
and confusion of face.&nbsp; But Latin, or Greek, or only English, or
not even English, there is no deception and no confusion here.&nbsp;
Forgiveness is really of free grace.&nbsp; It costs absolutely nothing,
the door is open; or, if it is not open, then knock, and it shall be
opened, without money and without price.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Free and full.&rsquo;&nbsp; I could imagine a free forgiveness
which was not also full.&nbsp; I could imagine a charter that would
have run somehow thus: Free forgiveness and full, up to a firmly fixed
limit.&nbsp; Free and full forgiveness for sins of ignorance and even
of infirmity and frailty; for small sins and for great sins, too, up
to a certain age of life and stage of guilt.&nbsp; Free and full forgiveness
up to a certain line, and then, that black line of reprobation, as Samuel
Rutherford says.&nbsp; Indeed, it is no imagination.&nbsp; I have felt
oftener than once that I was at last across that black line, and gone
and lost for ever.&nbsp; But no&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;While the lamp holds on to burn,<br />
The greatest sinner may return.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&lsquo;Free, full, and everlasting.&rsquo;&nbsp; Pope Innocent the
Third came to the rescue of King John and issued a Papal bull revoking
and annulling Magna Charta.&nbsp; But neither king, nor pope, nor devil
can revoke or annul our new Covenant.&nbsp; It is free, full, and everlasting.&nbsp;
If God be for us, who can be against us?&nbsp; Who shall separate us
from the love of Christ?&nbsp; Neither death nor life, nor angels nor
principalities nor powers, shall be able to separate us from the love
of God which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; &lsquo;Free, full, and everlasting forgiveness of all the
wrongs, the injuries, and the offences you have done against My Father,
Me, your neighbours, and yourselves.&rsquo;&nbsp; Now, out of all that
let us fix upon this&mdash;the wrongs and the injuries we have done
to our neighbours.&nbsp; For, as Calvin says somewhere, though our sins
against the first table of the law are our worst sins, yet our sins
against the second table, that is, against our neighbours, are far better
for beginning a scrutiny with.&nbsp; So they are.&nbsp; For our wrongs
against our neighbours, when they awaken within us at all, awaken with
a terrible fury.&nbsp; Our wrongs against our neighbours wound, and
burden, and exasperate an awakened conscience in a fearful way.&nbsp;
We come afterwards to say, Against Thee, Thee only have I sinned!&nbsp;
But at the first beginning of our repentances it is the wrongs we have
done to our neighbours that drive us beside ourselves.&nbsp; What neighbour
of yours, then, have you so wronged?&nbsp; Name him; name her.&nbsp;
You avoid that name like poison, but it is not poison&mdash;it is life
and peace.&nbsp; More depends on your often recollecting and often pronouncing
that hateful name than you would believe.&nbsp; More depends upon it
than your minister has ever told you.&nbsp; And, then, in what did you
so wrong him?&nbsp; Name the wrong also.&nbsp; Give it its Bible name,
its newspaper name, its brutal, vulgar, ill-mannered name.&nbsp; Do
not be too soft, do not be too courtly with yourself.&nbsp; Keep your
own evil name ever before you.&nbsp; When you hear any other man outlawed
and ostracised by that same name, say to yourself: Thou, sir, art the
man!&nbsp; Put out a secret and a painful skill upon yourself.&nbsp;
Have times and places and ways that nobody knows anything about&mdash;not
even those you have wronged; have times and places and ways they would
laugh to be told of, and would not believe it; times, I say, and places
and ways for bringing all those old wrongs you once did ever and ever
back to mind; as often back and as keen to your mind as they come back
to that other mind, which is still so full of the wrong.&nbsp; Even
if your victim has forgiven and forgotten you, never you forget him,
and never you forgive yourself when you again think of him.&nbsp; Welcome
back every sudden and sharp recollection of your wrong-doing.&nbsp;
And make haste at every such sudden recollection and fall down on the
spot in a deeper compunction than ever before.&nbsp; Do that as you
would be a forgiven and full-chartered soul.&nbsp; For, free and full
and everlasting as God&rsquo;s forgiveness is, you have no assurance
that it is yours if you ever forget your sin, or ever forgive yourself
for having done it.&nbsp; &lsquo;Forgive yourself,&rsquo; says Augustine,
&lsquo;and God will condemn you.&nbsp; But continually arraign and condemn
yourself, and God will forgive and acquit and justify you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; &lsquo;I give also My holy law and testament, and all that
therein is contained, for their everlasting comfort and consolation.&rsquo;&nbsp;
This is not the manner of men, O my God.&nbsp; Kind-hearted men comfort
and console those who have suffered injuries and wrongs at our hands,
but the kindest-hearted of men harden their hearts and set their faces
like a flint against us who have done the wrong.&nbsp; All Syria sympathised
with Esau for the loss of his birthright, but I do not read that any
one came to whisper one kind word to Jacob on his hard pillow.&nbsp;
All the army mourned over Uriah, but all the time David&rsquo;s moisture
was dried up like the drought of summer, and not even Nathan came to
the King till he could not help coming.&nbsp; All Jericho cried, Avenge
us of our adversary!&nbsp; But it was Jesus who looked up and saw Zaccheus
and said: Zaccheus, come down; make haste and come down, for to-day
I must abide at thy house.&nbsp; &lsquo;The injuries they have done
themselves also,&rsquo; so runs the very first head of our forgiveness
covenant.&nbsp; Ah! yes; O my Lord, Thou knowest all things; Thou knowest
my heart.&nbsp; Thou knowest that irremediably as I have injured other
men, yet in injuring them I have injured myself much more.&nbsp; And
much as other men need restitution, reparation, and consolation on my
account, my God, Thou knowest that I need all that much more&mdash;ten
thousand times more.&nbsp; Oh, how my broken heart within me leaps up
and thanks Thee for that Covenant.&nbsp; Let me repeat it again to Thy
praise: &lsquo;Full, free, and everlasting forgiveness of all wrongs,
injuries, and offences done by him against his neighbours and against
himself.&rsquo;&nbsp; Who, who is a God, O my God, who is a God like
unto Thee!</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; &lsquo;I do also give them a portion of the self-same grace
and goodness that dwells in My Father&rsquo;s heart and Mine.&rsquo;&nbsp;
The self-same grace and goodness, that is, that My Father and I have
shown to them.&nbsp; That is to say, we shall be made both willing and
able to grant to all those men who have wronged us the very same charter
of forgiveness that we have had granted to us of God.&nbsp; So that
at all those times when we stand praying for forgiveness we shall suspend
that prayer till we have first forgiven all our enemies, and all who
have at any time and in any way wronged or injured us.&nbsp; Even when
we had the Communion cup at our lips to-day, you would have seen us
setting it down till we had first gone and been reconciled to our brother.&nbsp;
Yes, my brethren, you are His witnesses that He has done it.&nbsp; He
has taken you into His covenant till He has made you both able and willing,
both willing and able, to grant and to bequeath to others, all that
free, full, and everlasting forgiveness and love that He has bequeathed
to you.&nbsp; Till under the very last and supreme wrong that your worst
enemy can do to you and to yours, you are able and forward to say: Father,
forgive him, for he knows not what he has done.&nbsp; Forgive me my
debts, you will say, as I forgive my debtors.&nbsp; And always, as you
again say and do that, you will on the spot be made a partaker of the
Divine Nature, according to the heavenly Charter, &lsquo;I do also give
them a portion of the self-same grace and goodness that dwells in My
Father&rsquo;s heart and in Mine.&rsquo;</p>
<p>5.&nbsp; &lsquo;I do also,&rsquo; so Mansoul&rsquo;s Magna Charta
travels on, &lsquo;I do also give, grant, and bestow upon them freely
the world and all that is therein for their good; yea, I grant them
all the benefits of life and of death, and of things present and things
to come.&rsquo;&nbsp; What a magnificent Charter is that!&nbsp; &lsquo;All
things are yours: whether Paul, or Apollos, or Cephas, or the world,
or life, or death, or things present, or things to come; all are yours.&rsquo;&nbsp;
What a superb Charter!&nbsp; Only, it is too high for us; we cannot
attain to it.&nbsp; Has any human being ever risen to anything like
the full faith, full assurance, and full victory of all that in this
life?&nbsp; No; the thing is impossible!&nbsp; Reason would fall off
her throne.&nbsp; The heart of a man would break with too much joy if
he tried to enter into the full belief of all that.&nbsp; No; it hath
not entered into the heart of a still sinful man what God hath chartered
to them whom He loves.&nbsp; This world, and all that therein is, and
then all the coming benefits of life and of death.&nbsp; What benefits
do believers receive from Christ at their death?&nbsp; We all drank
in the answer to that with our mother&rsquo;s milk, but what is behind
the words of that answer no mortal tongue can yet tell.&nbsp; All are
yours, and ye are Christ&rsquo;s, and Christ is God&rsquo;s.&nbsp; Till,
what joy, what comfort, what consolation, think you, did now possess
the hearts of the men of Mansoul!&nbsp; The bells rang, the minstrels
played, the people danced, the captains shouted, the colours waved in
the wind, and the silver trumpets sounded.</p>
<p>6.&nbsp; &lsquo;And till the glory breaks suddenly upon you, and
as long as you yet live in this life of free grace I shall give and
grant you leave and free access to Me in My palace at all seasons, there
to make known all your wants to Me; and I give you, moreover, a promise
that I will hear and redress all your grievances.&rsquo;&nbsp; At all
seasons; in season and out of season.&nbsp; There to make known all
your wants to Me.&nbsp; And all your grievances.&nbsp; All that still
grieves and vexes you.&nbsp; All your wrongs.&nbsp; All your injuries.&nbsp;
All that men can do to you.&nbsp; Let them do their worst to you.&nbsp;
My grace is sufficient for all your grievances.&nbsp; My goodness in
you shall make you more than a conqueror.&nbsp; I undertake to give
you before you have asked for it a heart full of free, full, and everlasting
forgiveness and forgetfulness of all that has begun to grieve you.&nbsp;
No word or deed, written or spoken, of any man shall be able to vex
or grieve the spirit that I shall put within you.&nbsp; You will immediately
avenge yourselves of your adversaries.&nbsp; You will instantly repay
them all an hundredfold.&nbsp; For, when thine enemy hungers, thou shalt
feed him; when he is athirst, thou shalt give him drink.&nbsp; For thou
shalt not be overcome of evil, but thou shalt overcome evil with good.</p>
<p>7.&nbsp; &lsquo;All these grants, privileges, and immunities I bestow
upon thee; upon thee, I say, and upon thy right seed after thee.&rsquo;&nbsp;
O Almighty God, our Heavenly Father, give us such a seed!&nbsp; Give
us a seed right with Thee!&nbsp; Smite us and our house with everlasting
barrenness rather than that our seed should not be right with Thee.&nbsp;
O God, give us our children.&nbsp; Give us our children.&nbsp; A second
time, and by a far better birth, give us our children to be beside us
in Thy holy Covenant.&nbsp; For it had been better we had never been
born; it had been better we had never been betrothed; it had been better
we had sat all our days solitary unless all our children are to be right
with Thee.&nbsp; Let the day perish, and the night wherein it was said,
There is a man-child conceived.&nbsp; Let that day be darkness; let
not God regard it from above; neither let the light shine upon it, unless
all our house is yet to be right with God.&nbsp; O my son Absalom!&nbsp;
My son, my son Absalom!&nbsp; Would God I had died for thee, O Absalom,
my son, my son!&nbsp; But thou, O God, art Thyself a Father, and thus
hast in Thyself a Father&rsquo;s heart.&nbsp; Hear us, then, for our
children, O our Father, for such of our children as are not yet right
with Thee!&nbsp; In season and out of season; we shall not go up into
our bed; we shall not give sleep to our eyes nor slumber to our eyelids
till we and all our seed are right with Thee.&nbsp; And then how we
and all our saved seed beside us shall praise Thee and bless Thee above
all the families on earth or in heaven, and shall say: Unto Him who
loved us and washed us from our sins in His own blood, and hath bestowed
upon us a free, full, and everlasting forgiveness, and hath made us
partakers of His Divine Nature, to Him be our love and praise and service
to all eternity.&nbsp; Amen and Amen!</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXVIII&mdash;EMMANUEL&rsquo;S LAST CHARGE TO MANSOUL: CONCERNING
THE REMAINDERS OF SIN IN THE REGENERATE</h2>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Hold fast till I come.&rsquo;&mdash;<i>Our Lord</i>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are many fine things in Emmanuel&rsquo;s last charge to Mansoul,
but by far the best thing is the answer that He Himself there supplies
to this deep and difficult question,&mdash;to this question, namely,
Why original sin is still left to rage in the truly regenerate?&nbsp;
Why does our Lord not wholly extirpate sin in our regeneration?&nbsp;
What can His reason be for leaving their original sin to dwell in His
best saints till the day of their death?&nbsp; For, to use His own sad
words about sin in His last charge, nothing hurts us but sin.&nbsp;
Nothing defiles and debases us but sin.&nbsp; Why, then, does He not
take our sin clean out of us at once?&nbsp; He could speak the word
of complete deliverance if He only would.&nbsp; Why, then, does He not
speak that word?&nbsp; That has been a mystery and a grief to all God&rsquo;s
saints ever since sanctification began to be.&nbsp; And the great interest
and the great value of Emmanuel&rsquo;s last charge to Mansoul stands
in this, that He here tells us, if not all, then at least some of His
reasons for the policy He pursues with us in our sanctification.&nbsp;
Dost thou know, He asks, as He stands on His chariot steps, surrounded
with His captains on the right hand and the left&mdash;Dost thou know
why I at first did, and do still, suffer sin to live and dwell and harbour
in thy heart?&nbsp; And then, after an <i>O yes</i>! for silence, the
Prince began and thus proceeded:</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; Dost thou ask at Me why I and My Father have seen it good
to allow the dregs of thy sinfulness still to corrupt and to rot in
thine heart?&nbsp; Dost thou ask why, amid so much in thee that is regenerate,
there is still so much more that is unregenerate?&nbsp; Why, while thou
art, without controversy, under grace, indwelling sin still so festers
and so breaks out in thee?&nbsp; Dost thou ask that?&nbsp; Then, attend,
and before I go away to come again I will try to tell thee, if, indeed,
thou art able and willing to bear it.&nbsp; Well, then, be silent while
I tell thee that I have left all that of thy original sin in thee to
tempt thee, to try thee, to humble thee, and to thrust, day and night,
upon thee, what is still in thine heart.&nbsp; To humble thee, take
knowledge, take warning, and take forethought.&nbsp; To make thee humble,
and to keep thee humble.&nbsp; To hide pride from thee, and to lay thee
all thy days on earth in the dust of death.&nbsp; I tell thee this day
that in all thy past life I have ordered and administered all My providences
toward thee to humble thee and to prove thee, and to make thee dust
and ashes in thine own eyes.&nbsp; And I go away to carry on from heaven
this same intention of My Father&rsquo;s and Mine toward thee.&nbsp;
We shall try thee as silver is tried.&nbsp; We shall sift thee as wheat
is sifted.&nbsp; We shall search thee as Jerusalem is searched with
lighted candles.&nbsp; I tell thee the truth, I shall bend from heaven
all My power which My Father has given Me, and all My wisdom, and all
My love, and all My grace.&nbsp; What to do, dost thou think?&nbsp;
What to do but to make thee to know and to acknowledge the plague of
thine own heart.&nbsp; The deceitfulness, that is, the depth of wickedness,
and the abominableness, past all words, of thine own heart.&nbsp; I
do not ascend to My Father, with all things in My hand, to make thy
seat soft, and thy cup sweet, and thy name great, and thy seed multiplied.&nbsp;
I have far other predestinations before Me for thee.&nbsp; I have loved
thee with an everlasting love, and it is to everlasting life that I
am leading thee.&nbsp; And thou must let Me lead thee through fire and
through water if I am to lead thee to heaven at last.&nbsp; I shall
have to utterly kill all self-love out of thy heart, and to plant all
humility in its place.&nbsp; Many and dreadful discoveries shall I have
to make to thee of thy profane and inhuman self-love and selfishness.&nbsp;
Words will fail thee to confess all thy selfishness in thy most penitent
prayer.&nbsp; Thy towering pride of heart also, and thy so contemptible
vanity.&nbsp; As for thy vanity, I shall so overrule it that double-minded
men about thee shall make thee and thy vanity their sport, their jest,
and their prey.&nbsp; And I shall not leave thee, nor discharge Myself
of My work within thee, till I see thee loathing thyself and hating
thyself and gnashing thy teeth at thyself for thy envy of thy brother,
thy envy concerning his house, his wife and his man-servant, and his
maid-servant, and his ox, and his ass, and everything that is his.&nbsp;
Thou shalt find something in thee that shall allow thee to see thine
enemy prosper, but not thy friend.&nbsp; Something that shall keep thee
from thy sleep because of his talents, his name, his income, and his
place which I have given him above thee, beside thee, and always in
thy sight.&nbsp; It will be something also that shall make his sickness,
his decay, his defamation, and his death sweet to thee, and his prosperity
and return to life bitter to thee.&nbsp; Thou shalt have to confess
something in thyself&mdash;whatever its nature and whatever its name&mdash;something
that shall make thee miserable at good news, and glad and enlarged and
full of life at evil tidings.&nbsp; It will be something also that shall
give a long life in thy evil heart to anger, and to resentment, and
to retaliation, and to revenge.&nbsp; For after years and years thou
shalt still have it in thine heart to hate and to hurt that man and
his house, because long ago he left thy side, thy booth in the market,
thy party in the state, and thy church in religion.&nbsp; As I live,
swore Emmanuel, standing up on the step of His ascending chariot, I
shall show thee thyself.&nbsp; I shall show thee what an unclean heart
is and a wicked.&nbsp; I shall teach to thee what all true saints shudder
at when they are let see the plague of their own hearts.&nbsp; I shall
show thee, as I live, how full of pride, and hate, and envy, and ill-will
a regenerate heart can be; and how a true-born man of God may still
love evil and hate good; may still rejoice in iniquity and pine under
the truth.&nbsp; I shall show thee, also, what thou wilt not as yet
believe, how thy best friend cannot trust his good name with thee; such
a sweet morsel to thee shall be the mote in his eye and the spot on
his praise.&nbsp; Yes, I shall show thee that I did not die on the cross
for nothing when I died for thee; when I went out to Calvary a shame
and a spitting, an outcast and a curse for thee!&nbsp; Thou shalt yet
arise up and fall down in thy sin and shalt justify all my thorns, and
nails, and spears, and the last drop of My blood for thee!&nbsp; Yea,
thou shalt remember all the way which the Lord thy God led thee these
forty years in the wilderness, to humble thee, and to prove thee, and
to know what was in thine heart, and whether thou wouldest keep His
commandments or no.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; It is also, the still tarrying Prince proceeded&mdash;it
is also to keep thee wakeful and to make thee watchful.&nbsp; Now, what
conceivable estate could any man be put into even by his Maker and Redeemer
more calculated to call forth wakefulness and watchfulness than to have
one half of his heart new and the other half old?&nbsp; To have one
half of his heart garrisoned by the captains of Emmanuel, and the other
half still full of the spies and the scouts and the emissaries of hell?&nbsp;
Nay, to have the great bulk of his heart still full of sin and but a
small part of his heart here and there under grace and truth?&nbsp;
Here is material for fightings without and fears within with a vengeance!&nbsp;
If it somehow suits and answers God&rsquo;s deep purposes with His people
to teach them watchfulness in this life, then here is a field for watchfulness,
a field of divine depth and scope and opportunity.&nbsp; There used
to be a divinity question set in the schools in these terms: Where,
in the regenerate, hath sin its lodging-place?&nbsp; For that sin does
still lodge in the regenerate is too abundantly evident both from Scripture
and from experience.&nbsp; But where it so lodges is the question.&nbsp;
The Dominican monks, and some others, were of opinion that original
sin is to be found only in the inferior part of the soul, but not in
the mind or the will.&nbsp; Which, I suppose, we shall soon find contrary
both to Scripture and reason and experience.&nbsp; Old Andrew Gray speaks
feelingly and no less truly concerning the heart, when he says, &lsquo;I
think,&rsquo; he says, &lsquo;that if all the saints since Adam&rsquo;s
day, and who shall be to the end of the world, had but one deceitful
heart to guide they would misguide it.&rsquo;&nbsp; What a plot of God,
then, it is to seat grace, a little saving grace, in the midst of such
a sea of corruption as a human heart is, and then to set a sinful man
to watch over that spark and to keep the boiling pollutions of his own
heart from extinguishing that spark!&nbsp; Well may Paul exclaim: Yea,
what carefulness it calls forth in us; yea, what indignation; yea, what
fear; yea, what vehement desire; yea, what zeal; yea, what revenge!&nbsp;
And, knowing to what He has left our hearts, well may Emmanuel say to
us from His ascending steps, &lsquo;Watch ye, therefore; and what I
say unto you, I say unto all, Watch!&rsquo;</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; It is to keep thee watchful and to teach thee war also,
the Prince went on.&nbsp; Bishop Butler is about the last author that
we would think of going to for light on any deep and intricate question
in the evangelical and experimental life.&nbsp; But Butler is so deeply
seen into much of the heart of man, as also into many of the ways of
God, that even here he has something to say to the point.&nbsp; &lsquo;It
is vain to object,&rsquo; he says in his sober and sobering way, &lsquo;that
all this trouble and danger might have been saved us by our being made
at once the creatures and the characters which we were to be.&nbsp;
For we experience that what we are to be is to be the effect of what
we shall do.&nbsp; And that the conduct of nature is not to save us
trouble and danger, but to make us capable of going through trouble
and danger, and to put it upon us to do it.&rsquo;&nbsp; The Apostle
Peter has the same teaching in a passage too little attended to, in
which he tells us that we are set here to work out our own salvation,
and that our salvation will just be what, with fear and trembling, or,
as Butler says, with trouble and danger, we work out.&nbsp; No man,
let all men understand, is to have his salvation thrust upon him.&nbsp;
No man need expect to waken up at the end of an idle, indifferent, inattentive
life and find his salvation superinduced upon all that.&nbsp; No man
shall wear the crown of everlasting life who has not for himself won
it.&nbsp; As every man soweth to the Spirit so also shall he reap.&nbsp;
As a soldier warreth, so shall he hear it said to him, Well done.&nbsp;
And as a sinner keeps his heart with all diligence, and holds it fast
till his King comes, so shall he hear it said to him, Thou hast been
faithful over a few things, I will make thee ruler over many things.&nbsp;
If thy sins, then, are left in thee to teach thee war, O poor saint
of God, then take to thee the whole armour of God; thou knowest the
pieces of it, and where the armoury is, and, having done all, stand!</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; And dost thou know, O Mansoul, that it is all to try thy
love also?&nbsp; Now, how, just how, do the remainders of sin in the
regenerate try their love?&nbsp; Why, surely, in this way.&nbsp; If
we really loved sin at the deepest bottom of our hearts, and only loved
holiness on the surface, would we not in our deepest hearts close with
sin, give ourselves up to it, and make no stand at all against it?&nbsp;
Would we not in our deepest and most secret hearts welcome it, and embrace
it, look out for it with desire and delight, and part with it with regret?&nbsp;
But if, as a matter of fact, we at our deepest and most hidden heart
turn from sin, flee from it, fight against it, rejoice when we are rid
of it, and have horror at the return of it,&mdash;what better proof
than that could Christ and His angels have that at bottom we are His
and not the devil&rsquo;s?&nbsp; And that grace, at bottom, has our
hearts, and not sin; heaven, and not hell?&nbsp; The apostle&rsquo;s
protesting cry is our cry also; we also delight in the law of God after
our most inward man.&nbsp; For, after our saddest surprises into sin,
after its worst outbreaks and overthrows, such all the time were our
reluctances, recalcitrations, and resistances, that, swept away as we
were, yet all the time, and after it was again over, it was with some
good conscience that we said to Christ that He knew all things, and
that He knew that we loved Him.</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;O benefit of ill! now I find true<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That better is by evil still made better;<br />
And ruined love, when it is built anew,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Grows fairer than at first, more strong, far greater,<br />
So I return rebuked to my content,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And gain by ill thrice more than I have spent.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes; it is a sure and certain proof how truly we love our dearest
friend, that, after all our envy and ill-will, yet it is as true as
that God is in heaven that, all the time, maugre the devil of self that
remains in our heart,&mdash;after he has done his worst&mdash;we would
still pluck out our eyes for our friend and shed our blood.&nbsp; I
have no better proof to myself of the depth and the divineness of my
love to my friend than just this, that I still love him and love him
more tenderly and loyally, after having so treacherously hurt him.&nbsp;
And my heavenly friends and my earthly friends, if they will still have
me, must both be content to go into the same bundle both of my remaining
enmity and my increasing love; my remainders of sin, and my slow growth
in regeneration.&nbsp; So when they had dined, Jesus saith to Simon
Peter, Simon, son of Jonas, lovest thou Me more than these?&nbsp; He
saith unto Him, Yea, Lord; Thou knowest that I love Thee.&nbsp; He saith
unto him again the second time, Simon, son of Jonas, lovest thou Me?&nbsp;
He saith unto Him, Yea, Lord; thou knowest that I love Thee.&nbsp; He
saith unto him the third time, Simon, son of Jonas, lovest thou Me?&nbsp;
Peter was grieved because He said unto him the third time, Lovest thou
Me?&nbsp; And he said unto Him, Lord, Thou knowest all things; Thou
knowest that I love Thee!</p>
<p>5.&nbsp; And, to sum up all&mdash;more than your humility, more than
your watchfulness, more than your prayerfulness, more than to teach
you war, and more than to try your love, the dregs and remainders of
sin have been left in your regenerate heart to exalt and to extol the
grace of God.&nbsp; In Emmanuel&rsquo;s very words, it has all been
to make you a monument of God&rsquo;s mercy.&nbsp; I put it to yourselves,
then, ye people of God: does that not satisfy you for a reason, and
for an explanation, and for a justification of all your shame and pain,
and of all your bondage and misery and wretchedness since you knew the
Lord?&nbsp; Is there not a heart in you that says, Yes! it was worth
all my corruption and pollution and misery to help to manifest forth
and to magnify the glory of the grace of God?&nbsp; You seize on Emmanuel&rsquo;s
word that you are a monument of mercy.&nbsp; Somehow that word pleases
and reposes you.&nbsp; Yes, that is what out of all these post-regeneration
years you are.&nbsp; You would have been a monument to God&rsquo;s mercy
had you, like the thief on the cross, been glorified on the same day
on which you were first justified.&nbsp; But it will neither be the
day of your justification nor the day of your glorification that will
make you the greatest of all the monuments that shall ever be raised
to the praise of God&rsquo;s grace; it will be the days of your sanctification
that will do that.&nbsp; Paul was a blasphemer and a persecutor and
injurious at his conversion, but he had to be a lifetime in grace and
an apostle above all the twelve before he became the chiefest of sinners
and the most wretched of saints.&nbsp; And though your first forgiveness
was, no doubt, a great proof of the grace of God, yet it was nothing,
nothing at all, to your forgiveness to-day.&nbsp; You had no words for
the wonder and the praise of your forgiveness to-day.&nbsp; You just
took to your lips the cup of salvation and let that silent action speak
aloud your monumental praise.&nbsp; You were a sinner at your regeneration,
else you would not have been regenerated.&nbsp; But you were not then
the chief of sinners.&nbsp; But now.&nbsp; Ah, now!&nbsp; Those words,
the chief of sinners, were but idle words in Paul&rsquo;s mouth.&nbsp;
He did not know what he was saying.&nbsp; For, what has horrified and
offended other men when it has been spoken with bated breath to them
about envy, and hate, and malice, and revenge, and suchlike remainders
of hell, all that has been a breath of life and hope to you.&nbsp; It
has been to you as when Christian, in the Valley of the Shadow of Death,
heard a voice in the darkness which proved to him that there was another
sinner at the mouth of hell besides himself.&nbsp; There is no text
that comes oftener to your mind than this, that whoso hateth his brother
is a murderer; and, communicant as you are, you feel and you know and
you are sure that there are many men lying in lime waiting the day of
judgment to whom it would be more tolerable than for you were it not
that you are to be at that day the highest monument in heaven or earth
to the redeeming, pardoning, and saving grace of God.&nbsp; Yes, this
is the name that shall be written on you; this is the name that shall
be read on you of all who shall see you in heaven; this name that Emmanuel
pronounced over Mansoul that day from His ascending chariot-steps, a
very Spectacle of wonder, and a very Monument of the mercy and the grace
of God.</p>

effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.net/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit:

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
